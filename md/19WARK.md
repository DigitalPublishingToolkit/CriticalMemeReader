# A Postdigital Angel of History? On ‘Meme Theory’

###Scott Wark


## 0.

I found the image above, an instance of the ‘Distracted Boyfriend’ meme,
sometime in 2018. I thought this meme was funny at the time—and also
crass, casually misogynistic, and layered with far too much irony. My
opinion hasn’t changed in the intervening period. But nor has my
fascination with this meme.

I’m going to use this meme in a way that’s deliberately, bluntly, and
somewhat stupidly literal. What if—bear with me—this meme perfectly
represents a (post-)digital version of Walter Benjamin’s ‘angel of
history’? What if it perfectly figures how ‘one pictures the angel of
history’ and the ‘wreckage… in front of his feet’ blown in by the
‘storm… we call progress’[^16chapter15_1] in our postdigital present?

## 1. 

In the essay that probably did the most work to popularise the term,
Florian Cramer, argues that the ’simplest definition of “post-digital”
describes a media aesthetics which opposes… digital high-tech and
high-fidelity cleanness.’[^16chapter15_2] For Cramer, this concept is best
understood by reading artistic practices as symptoms. The early internet
had a certain aesthetic and a particular iconography: acid green text,
dark screens, the backwash from CRT monitors illuminating faces open to
possibility. Now, consumer technology is advertised at us using gauche,
primary-coloured scenes peopled with elongated, barely-humanoid figures
using what’s known as ‘Corporate Memphis’ style.[^16chapter15_3] Moreover, he argues
that the tendency for younger creatives—not to mention consumers—to
remediate and rehabilitate older technologies, like vinyl records, ought
to be read as a pervasive reaction against digital technology and its
promises. Cramer’s ‘post-digital’ names an aesthetic that embraces the
old, the noisy, the unpredictable and the unruly in reaction to digital
technology’s contemporary banality. It registers the routinisation of
the possibility that digital technology once held.

Cramer developed the concept of the post-digital as a kind
tongue-in-cheek dialectical periodization: of course, we’re not really
*after* the digital, because the digital pervades everything we do. But
whilst the specificities of the dialectical process that Cramer
identifies—the proliferation of *new* media reaching a degree of
ubiquity that sparks a backlash, in the form of an aesthetic, defined by
the embrace of the *old*—feels somewhat dated, the condition he
identified has not.

Our contemporary post-digital situation is still one in which media
overwhelm us. We may have gotten used to the novelty of everything being
digital, but we have arguably yet to formulate or formalize techniques
for thinking media in this situation. If, for Cramer, the way in to this
problem is through aesthetics, I prefer to think of it as a concrete
condition for thinking media today.

The pervasiveness and banality of digital media has created a situation
in which thinking media requires us to think *with* media that are,
because of their scale, their opacity, and their proprietary nature,
quite *un*thinkable. The question we need to ask is this: how are we
supposed to think media, to determine what they are, in conditions in
which they are constitutively *in*determinate?

That’s the situation. But you probably came for the memes. The thing is,
this is the situation in which we have to try to think internet memes.
What I’m saying is that Internet memes can be used to help us think our
way through our contemporary post-digital media situation.

<br/>

By the time I found this example of the ‘Distracted Boyfriend’ meme, the
meme itself was kind of over. It persists today as a particularly
widespread and popular memetic form, but it’s no longer novel. It
survived an attempt by the Swedish government to identify it as
misogynistic.[^16chapter15_4] It even survived an image belonging to its series
being used in a political campaign by Fidesz, the far-right party of
Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán.[^16chapter15_5] Through overuse and by
attracting incidental mainstream attention, in other words, it’s become
part of online culture’s backdrop, another fixture.

And yet here I am, writing an essay about this meme. Why? Because its
arbitrary conjunctions have something to tell us about the conditions in
which we’re forced to think media today.

This meme began its life as a stock image: a photograph or illustration
of an everyday scene that one can purchase to lend a little vitality or
visual interest to a website’s lifeless scaffolding. The original
retains this recognisably-banal aesthetic, but it also has something
more. The leering histrionics of its titular character, distracted by a
passing woman and so turning from his—or so we’re given to
assume—girlfriend, breaks the stock photograph mould. If this is a scene
from everyday life, it’s not one in which we’re supposed to recognise
ourselves. This image is supposed to be part of a series, but it stands
out—and has become singular.

From this cursory engagement, we can draw three preliminary points. This
relationship between singularity and seriality is a complex one. Though
already part of a series, the singularity of this image allowed
‘Distracted Boyfriend’ to transform from a viral image—something copied
and shared without modification[^16chapter15_6]—into an iterable and *re*iterable
internet meme. These steps are worth noting, because they represent one
means for a meme to emerge out of pervasive, circulating media.
Moreover, as their popular scholarly proponents would have it, internet
memes are collective online-cultural products.[^16chapter15_7] But as they are also
media, they can’t be separated from the prevailing technical-aesthetic
conditions in which they’re produced.

## 3.

What does it mean to call the post-digital a condition? I don’t mean it
to be thought of as a condition in the sense of a ‘condition of
possibility.’ That kind of ontological thinking is beyond this essay’s
ken. Rather, by ‘condition’ I mean the concrete conditions in which one
is forced to think media.

I have in mind here two of Friedrich Kittler’s claims. First, the one
that gets quoted all the time, both because it’s gnomic and suggestive
and because it is literally the first line of his most famous book:
‘media determine our situation.’[^16chapter15_8] But second, from an older, denser
essay—and here I’m paraphrasing, because it’s much less quotable—that
media constitute the conditions of possibility for theorisation
itself.[^16chapter15_9] This latter claim isn’t meant to be a grand one. In a
section of this essay describing how philosophers actually *do*
philosophy, Kittler points out that philosophising—let’s say, for the
sake of sounding at least a little less pretentious,
*theorising*—requires an entire “apparatus” of tools to actually be
done.[^16chapter15_10] The essay is old, so the apparatus he describes includes
lists books, pens, notes, bookmarks, marginalia, and index cards; the
library, the stacks, the desk. The contemporary equivalent might include
PDFs, word processing or note taking apps, highlight functions, and
bibliographic managers; or, the search engine, the publishers’
platforms, the desktop.

The analogy holds insofar as these tools have a degree of equivalency.
But times have changed—and so have media. Media’s contemporary ubiquity
and pervasiveness create a different set of conditions for the
production of knowledge in general and theoretical knowledge in
particular.

## 4.

In yet another essay, Kittler infamously proposed a tripartite
‘elementary definition of media’: media are that which ‘record,
transmit, and process information.’[^16chapter15_11] Matthew Fuller has recently
been moved to add a fourth term to this elementary definition. What we
call ‘media’ today ‘have in many cases become a subset of computational
systems’.[^16chapter15_12] For instance, the app that I use to take photographs on
my phone is a kind of media, in that it records, transmits, and
processes information; but it is also dependent on my phone, itself a
kind of media. Identifying media *as* media requires what Fuller calls
’analysis’: ‘the breaking down of complex entities into what, at a
certain scale, can be read as nominally fundamental units, and working
out their immanent, potential, or emergent relationships.’[^16chapter15_13]

Kittler’s media were discrete: gramophone, film, typewriter; their
apotheosis, the computer—itself a product, so he claimed, of a
twentieth-century war machine. Today, media are profligate. Phone, app,
and, finally, the image it produces; all are media made possible by
computation, rendered *discretizable*, or apprehensible as singular
objects, by Fuller’s fourth feature, the capacity to analyze. The thing
about this fourth capacity, though, is that isn’t necessarily something
that we can do without help. Most of us aren’t peering at a program’s
code—or, indeed, the electrical impulses that are computation’s material
basis[^16chapter15_14]—and isolating *this* or *that* as media. Media do that for
us.

I don’t mean to claim that our tools think us. I’m not in to
panpsychism. All I’m saying is that thinking media requires using media
to think. It’s a relatively banal claim, in one sense: tools shape
thought. It lacks the grand framing of Kittler’s war machine, too; its
motivating force, advertising, is also much more banal. But given the
scale at which media operate, the degree to which they pervade our
everyday lives, their contemporary ubiquity, this claim has a little
more force.

## 5.

The term ‘tools’ is somewhat misleading. I’m typing this out on my 2018
Macbook Air (a cute Rose Gold model). It’s easy to see this as a tool,
an equivalent to Kittler’s ‘apparatus.’ But our media situation is a
specific one. Ours is the age of massively-distributed media systems.
For parsimony’s sake, let’s call it the age of the platform.

The platform is a specific kind of computational architecture defined,
most simply, by its programmability. Most social media are platforms. So
are most of Google’s main products, Amazon’s marketplace, and Apple’s
devices. But so, too, are cloud computing systems, which allow customers
to hire out computing power to perform complex and intensive processing
tasks remotely. All of these systems are different; what unifies them is
their capacity to act as ‘platforms’ for other applications or
processes.

This essay is supposed to be about memes, so let’s focus on the sites
where they’re most often encountered online: social media platforms. For
my money, Anne Helmond’s early theorization of social media platforms is
still the simplest and the best. According to her, these systems have
been created to ‘decentralize \[sic\]’ the production of media *content*
to their users, but ‘recentralize \[sic\]’ the collection of data
produced *by* those users to the platform itself.[^16chapter15_15] As you no doubt
know, this data forms the basis of their business model.[^16chapter15_16] But that’s
not our focus. By standardizing and streamlining the capacity for users
produce and share media content—by, in fact, requiring users to do so in
order for them to have any content at all—platforms have massively
intensified the *amount* of media in circulation.

This asymmetrical infrastructure and excess of circulating media aren’t
really homologous with ‘tools.’ They constitute a new ‘situation’—what I
interpret as a set of concrete mediatic conditions. Moreover, the excess
of circulating media they make possible is so overwhelming, and subject
to such frequent change as it’s produced and reproduced by its
participants, as to be hard to determine at any one moment.

Cramer’s post-digital dialectic presents the interplay between new and
old as the defining conflict that generates media aesthetics today. But
perhaps this is the right frame with the wrong conceptual drapery. In
the constantly interplay of new and old—or new becoming old—perhaps what
persists, as online culture reproduces itself with every refreshed feed,
is not a particular aesthetic, but simply a sense of perpetual ruin,
perpetual obsolescence, new becoming old through bland repetition.

![Fig. 2: Distracted Angel of History. Digital Image. Originally seen on Twitter, late-2018. Archived at: Know Your Meme. <https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1290289-distracted-boyfriend>](/Users/c.c.arkenbouthva.nl/Documents/GitHub/CriticalMemeReader/imgs/15.1.jpeg)

Let’s try to draw all of these conceptual threads together by returning to my original conceit: ‘Distracted Boyfriend’ manifesting a
post-digital ‘angel of history.’

Why slap a cropped image of Paul Klee’s *Angelus Novus* into a
‘Distracted Boyfriend’ meme? Whilst it made me giggle when I first saw
it, the Venn diagram representing people who read Walter Benjamin and
regularly consume memes must be, if not vanishingly small, then not far
off. Nevertheless, someone thought it would be funny. So, let’s take it
at face value.

The joke is a fairly simple one. In ‘On the Concept of History,’
Benjamin invokes the figure of the angel of history to give form to the
unfolding of historical time. He does so by describing the central
figure in a print by Paul Klee called *Angelus Novus* – that’s the weird
figure in the meme above. In this short passage, Benjamin describes this
angel as wide-eyed, open-mouthed, and spread-winged, seeming ‘about to
move away from something he stares at.’[^16chapter15_17] Benjamin sees this figure’s
face as being ‘turned toward the past,’ looking on the unfolding of time
and seeing not a ‘chain of events,’ but ‘one single catastrophe, which
keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it at his feet.’ Only, he
can’t do anything about this catastrophe, because ‘a storm is blowing
from Paradise and has got caught in his wings; it is so strong that the
angel can no longer close them.’[^16chapter15_18] The joke, if you weren’t in on it
already, ought now to be clear: the angel as ‘Distracted Boyfriend’
turned into figure of abstract-historical catastrophe.

Briefly, I want to note that I know that explaining jokes is just about
the worst thing one can do in an essay. But there’s nothing for it now
but to keep going, to see if we can make this particular one funny once
again.

In the bit of the passage that’s most resonant of all, Benjamin says
that ’\[t\]his storm drives \[the angel\] irresistibly into the future,
to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows
toward the sky.’ He finishes by saying this: ‘\[w\]hat we call progress
is *this* storm.’[^16chapter15_19] There’s a lot riding on this line: a thesis about
the historical-materialist need to disentangle our conception of
“history” from the idea of ‘progress’; a sense of doom generated by the
contemporaneous emergence of Nazism, which forced Benjamin to flee
Berlin; an attempt to return a sense of Messianic purpose to Marxism’s
promise of a revolution-to-come. All of which can be projected on this
meme but which, at the same time, it repudiates. Or not.

This particular meme can’t possibly bear all of this conceptual baggage.
It’s just a joke, substituting Klee’s angel, and Benjamin’s conception
of it, for a gross and leering man. But even if it couldn’t even begin
to thematise a world-historical ‘catastrophe,’ it still has a lot to
tell us about the how one *ought* to picture progress in our postdigital
media situation – and about the debris it leaves.

## 7.

What would it mean to take this meme as a post-digital version of
Benjamin’s ‘angel of history’?

Insofar as the concept of the post-digital is a tongue-in-cheek
periodisation—both aware that it’s insufficient whilst also, as a failed
attempt at portioning out history, revealing something about our times –
it necessarily contains a conception of history within itself. This
conception of history is concerned with the present and its aesthetics,
rather than high-falutin’ concepts like progress or revolution. But it’s
a conception of history nonetheless.

In this conception of history, media *are present*. That is, their sheer
ubiquity conditions the present as the present’s concrete conditions. We
might be able to get at the shape of the present by seeking to
understand the large-scale forces that structure it—like, for instance,
the platform. But we can also get at it by sifting through its debris.
Like internet memes.

The dialectic Cramer outlines is less a form, a shape of things that
have come and will again, than a function. Because media are everywhere,
so too are their debris. This condition of ubiquity (of media become
post-digital because of their pervasiveness) and ruin (of media’s
constant obsolescence) is necessary for the emergence of meme culture.
But it’s not sufficient. It also requires an excess. Internet memes
*present* the conjunction of technology, cultural production, and
aesthetics that make their production possible *to us*. They do so by
manifesting these conditions in and as they are iterated and are
reiterated; or, in other words, as they circulate, in excess.

The indeterminacy that characterises our post-digital media situation
might be a product of computational infrastructures, like platforms. But
these infrastructures are proprietary, opaque, black-boxed –
inaccessible, in general, to you or I. In excess and as they circulate,
what internet memes manifest is a condition of being overwhelmed by
media—and being forced to think within this condition whilst also, and
necessarily, thinking this condition. Of being *platformed*. This is
something we *can* think.

## 8.

So perhaps this particular ‘Distracted Boyfriend’ meme is actually the
angel of history we deserve in our post-digital present. What can we
learn from it? A few things.

First, it’s very, very easy for media like internet memes to become
overdetermined, to stand in for much more than they can bear. But
regardless of how far one might wish to push a particular conceptual
conceit, the *form* of thinking these kinds of media force on us, as
they circulate in excess and as a kind of post-digital debris, is
something we can use. To recall Kittler, insofar as media constitute the
conditions of possibility for theorisation itself, *we can only really
think media today through this kind of debris*.

These are the rudiments of a kind of theorisation that I call ‘meme
theory.’ We’ve been dragged into the wake of a force that keeps ‘piling
wreckage upon wreckage.’ Let’s call this figure what it is: not an
angel, but an internet meme; not an internet meme in particular, or even
internet memes in general, but cultural practices and mediated modes of
production that continue to be iterated and reiterated in circulation,
changing what it is that media *are* too quickly for us to keep pace.
All we can do is toss our concepts—of memes, of media, and of their
computational infrastructures—into the wake and salvage what we can.

More programmatically: to conceptualise media today, our theoretical
practices have to remain responsive to those media. This isn’t so
high-falutin’ after all. It’s just a practice, a way of doing things,
that recognises the banal and yet pervasive conditioning influence media
exercise on our concepts of them.

## ADDENDA

### i. 

The thing about the angel of history is that is has always been a meme.

Or: a proposition, in the form of an image, that mutates with its
mediatic conditions of production; and, that reflects, in each of its
usages, how these conditions change, inasmuch as the angel’s *messianic*
indeterminacy stays the same.

At least, that’s one way of reading Benjamin’s other most famous essay
into the present.[^16chapter15_20]

### ii.

Is all of this too much for the meme concept to bear?

Probably. In any attempt to work out the relation between a concept and
its objects in a concrete situation, though, we find what I’m calling
‘meme theory.’ Benjamin’s angel is simply a particularly useful figure
for bringing the ruins of our contemporary post-digital present into
frame. After all, that’s what memes do: they figure.

iii.

If the figure of the angel of history is a meme, the ‘Distracted
Boyfriend’ meme’s backward gaze tells us something else about our
present. The thing about the dialectic that I pinched from Cramer and
applied to this meme is that it has its own remainder, or irrecuperable
excess. In Cramer, that excess is those technical ‘systems’ that we are
forced to either over-identify with, or to repudiate[^16chapter15_21]—systems that,
he tacitly argues, we cannot overcome no matter how hard we try. Leaving
aside his focus on aesthetic practices, we can use this dialectic of
identification and repudiation to think through *meme cultures’*
irrecuperable excesses.

Amongst many other things, ‘Distracted Boyfriend’ figures a kind of
pervasive, low-key misogyny common in contemporary society and often
heightened online. What online culture thinks is *formally* subversive,
and therefore ironically funny, might change; but no matter how often
this culture’s proponents protest that it’s all ‘a joke’, the joke can
never wholly encompass this toxicity. Irony in memes—and online-cultural
irony in general—can never use the *form* of memetic play to fully
nullify the cultural-political charge of these kinds of determinations.
This is why even the crassest of memes always flirt, seemingly
incongruously, with politics.

Do we not get the angels we deserve? If so, it’s no wonder that what
this post-digital angel figures, amongst everything else, is toxic
masculinity. The ‘storm… we call progress,’ indeed.[^16chapter15_22]
