# ‘The Disturbingly Humanoid Face of the Lamb of God Has Shocked Many’: Visual Strategies in Internet Memes on the Restoration of the *Ghent Altarpiece*

###By Martin Hanßen

What do the Lamb of God painted by Hubert and Jan van Eyck in 1432 and
Kylie Jenner have in common? Well, a variation of the *Ghent Altarpiece
Lamb Restoration Meme* might just have the answer. The meme juxtaposes
Kylie’s face with the head of the Mystic Lamb after its recent
restoration. The comparison is captioned ‘So apparently they restored
the Ghent altarpiece and:’ (Fig. 1). You can kind of get the resemblance
between the two faces: the lamb’s head to the left with its bug-eyed
stare, jutting Shrek ears, lantern jaw, and daring pout *is* faintly
reminiscent of Kylie’s strong bone structure, saucer eyes and (in)famous
full lips. But while the two images do share similarities in their own
respect, it is the caption that draws them into equivalence and, in
essence, makes the joke.

Indeed, it is the same text that captions the initial form of the meme
(Fig. 2), and the difference is remarkable: on the left, we see the
center of the altarpiece prior to restoration. It is characterized by
its naturalistic, almost mimetic depiction of a sheep featuring slightly
askew eyes on the side of the head (just where the eyes of a flight
animal are naturally positioned), a broad nasal bridge ending in
tenderly pink y-shaped nostrils and philtrum, and ears obliquely
sticking out on top of its head. Looking straight at the viewer with a
subtle smile, the image gives the impression of a passively observing
animal that does compellingly resemble the natural look of a sheep—bar,
perhaps, the odd structure that weirdly sticks out of the left side of
the head which turned out to be the animal’s original right ear. To the
right, separated by a vertical black line, the now-revealed true face of
the lamb looks strikingly unlike a sheep, almost grotesque.

<br/>

As a way of making the restored lamb’s head tangible for the internet
community, both variations choose comparative vision: a traditional yet
effective method of image criticism. In doing so, the memes elucidate
formal parallels between the heads in question and so mockingly comment
on the restoration of the *Ghent Altarpiece*. Just as with comparative
vision, they place two images from different contexts in contrast and
assess them primarily based on their formal characteristics, which
already suggests their analogy (or their shortcomings, respectively).

[^13chapter11_1] Thus, the image pairings are implemented as a purely visual
argument that claims similarity or difference of the images, and is
supposed to give proof of formal analogies tied together by a brief,
provocative comment.

Nevertheless, let’s not forget that the head of the Mystic Lamb in van
Eyck’s painting is only about the size of a walnut, mingling as it does
with the myriad other pictorial elements of the 24 panels of the
altarpiece. It is in cropping down the artwork to its very center, where
the lamb’s head is depicted as the iconographic climax that the formal
likeness to Kylie’s face is finally achieved. But even if the comparison
of the lamb and her face is bewildering at first glance, it does
not—after all—highlight a factual equivalence. Especially in the
pop-cultural context of social networks, comparative vision is likely to
be narrowed in its capabilities. This happens as polarizing images like
these are paired—original/copy, before/after or right/wrong—in order to
provide visual evidence or illustrate causalities.[^13chapter11_2] Most internet
memes make use of such incongruous couplings and anomalous
juxtapositions, which are deliberately provocative and as bizarre as
possible.[^13chapter11_3] In pairing the Lamb of God with a sensational example of
internet culture like the \#KylieJennerLipChallenge, or by highlighting
the drastic changes of the head during the restoration process, the
memes seem to look for juxtapositions which specifically cater to the
shock humor and the rapture for spectacle of the net community and, at
the same time, illustrate their point of criticism.[^13chapter11_4] But what is so
shocking about the restoration of the altarpiece anyway, particularly
regarding the restoration of the Mystic Lamb? Keeping in mind that the
*Ghent Altarpiece* has, ever since its creation, been appreciated as
*the* most significant testimony of late medieval European art by art
historians and art lovers alike, the conspicuous transformation of this
important detail *is* quite shocking from an amateur perspective.[^13chapter11_5]

Already prior to the unveiling of the restored panel with the *Adoration
of the Mystic Lamb* (Fig. 4) in Ghent on December 24^th^, 2019, online
press had picked up on the incongruous depiction of the lamb’s head.
Most articles were illustrated with a comparison of the lamb prior to
and after restoration in a manner pretty much identical to the
juxtaposition later seen in the meme.[^13chapter11_6] Additionally, the media
quickly adopted a certain sneering rhetoric regarding the restoration
campaign: calling the face ‘disturbingly humanoid’ or ‘alarmingly
anthropomorphic’, immediately evoking a comparison of the Lamb of God to
human physiognomyanticipating the comparison to Kylie that followed
about a month later.

By picking up this rhetoric of a ‘disturbingly humanoid’ sheep, yet
another variation of the *Ghent Altarpiece Lamb Restoration Meme*
introduces a different strategy to criticize van Eyck’s Lamb of God.
Instead of utilizing the image of the Mystic Lamb, this meme opts for an
image of the anthropomorphized face of children’s show character Shaun
the Sheep floating before a greenish-blue backdrop. It is captioned:
‘The disturbingly humanoid face of the lamb of God has shocked many …’
(Fig. 3). Here, it is apparent that the user expects their peers to get
the joke based on their awareness of the memetic discourse and media
coverage of the restoration. While in the other examples it is the image
or image pairing that specifies the context of the discussion about the
restoration, in this variation of the meme the joke lies in the caption
as there is no visual reference to the artwork in question. Captions,
however, always influence the way images will be read by the viewer and
the meaning of the image is altered by the sequence of all its preceding
captions.[^13chapter11_7] Following this quality of captions, the variation ties in
with its memetic relatives not by implementing the same imagery, or by
making use of comparative vision as its visual strategy, but simply by
including the framing rhetoric of online press in its caption. The text
enables a reading of the image of Shaun’s face as an example of van
Eyck’s humanoid lamb as the ekphrasis generates visual
correspondence.[^13chapter11_8] At the same time, the image itself does share formal
characteristics with the square portrait of the Lamb of God that is used
by all the other memetic variations. It appears to offer enough visual
equivalence to the other images that cluster around the ‘failed’
restoration to support the caption’s ironic claim—even if the work of
art itself is not depicted and the lack of comparative vision undermines
the processual character of the before-and-after-idea.

humanoid’, picking up online media rhetoric. Posted by @CheeseWorrier to <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter.com</a> on 22 January 2020.](imgs/11.3.jpeg)

<br/>

In combining images with witty captions internet users apparently had a
great time joking about the restoration of the *Ghent Altarpiece*.
However, all of the variations make use of similar—if not the
identical—visual strategies to frame the recovered head of the Lamb of
God. This is to say that they all rely on a network of images that are
in some way related to each other to create the joke and criticize the
post-restoration Lamb of God primarily by highlighting formal
similarities or differences. Based on the concept of comparative vision,
these images, together with their textual add-ons, function as profound,
taunting judgements. They deliberately juxtapose the head of the Mystic
Lamb to historic and expressive moments of online communication—moments
which are etched into the memory of its users—to hint at the broader
history of *lulz* within the online community. As artifacts of a
collective memory of internet culture, these images offer references by
which the phenomenon of a ‘disturbingly humanoid’ face ties back to and
is explained within the visual culture of the internet.[^13chapter11_9]

## (Re-)Formatting the Altarpiece

When the extensive overpainting was removed, the Lamb of God was only
one of many details that changed drastically throughout the restoration
of the altarpiece. But it was this specific transformation that caused
quite the stir on social media. Why might the head have had such a
memetic career? Apart from the facts that it sits at the very center of
the retable and is also the eponym of the alternative name of the
artwork, it may be that the head functions as a focal point of ironic
criticism, catering to the visual habits of meme creators and consumers
alike. Not only is the comparison of the before and after visually
effective, but the image of the ‘alarmingly humanoid’ face immediately
reminds internet users of the many other images of the same format and
pictorial object. Case in point, the selfie: a squared-up close-up of a
face taken at arm’s length, in which snoots, grimaces and many other
facial expressions are encoded in complex nuances which can nevertheless
be unambiguously deciphered by its users within seconds. Selfies and
similar mugshots usually pop up in very distinct moments of online
communication, evoking and fulfilling certain reactions and expectations
of net users.[^13chapter11_10] Keeping in mind the very specific role of portraits
of comical faces in digital communication, the headshot of the Mystic
Lamb also proves convenient in countless other memetic circumstances
beyond commentaries on the restoration campaign.

While the term *format* is nowadays heterogenous in meaning, within the
discipline of art history it is traditionally used to describe the
dimensions and aspect ratio of a work of art. Furthermore, it identifies
different format types with their very own material, dimensional and
symbolic peculiarities. Within this definition, the format itself is
regarded as the product of a formatting process through which the
borders of an image are defined, and its visual dimensions and
properties are specified.[^13chapter11_11] Accordingly, it restricts the pictorial
object, as it determines what is to be seen in an image. In the case of
the portrait, for example, viewers will always expect face-like features
in what they see, although they will not necessarily encounter a human
sitter. This shows that whatever is depicted acts within the terms of
its format, no matter what the pictorial object is.[^13chapter11_12] Consequently,
formats—like captions—fulfil an important role in how images are seen by
encoding the object. In the case of the *Ghent Altarpiece Lamb
Restoration Meme,* this means that by simply cropping the lamb’s head to
a square portrait, the format alone suggests similarities to the human
face.

However, the case of the ‘alarmingly humanoid’ lamb cannot be entirely
put down to a formatting process. The image of the restored head itself
is a detail of a digital photograph that has been cropped into a
close-up portrait. Accordingly, cropping the photograph of the original
painting needs to be regarded as a process of strategic reformatting.
This means that the previous dimensions of the original digital image
have been changed in order to align it to the already-established square
portrait format with its very own formal aspirations, meanings, and
expectations in digital communication, as well as to the image
repertoire of net culture. In doing so, the very complex reference
system of the original painting is lost: the identification of the Lamb
of God with Jesus Christ, for example, as it is sacrificed on the altar
and the *Precious Blood* spills into the golden chalice in presence of
the Holy Spirit representing the transubstantiation*.* Also lost is the
Lamb’s exposure to the *Arma Christi* or the *Fountain of Life* which
again emphasizes the lamb as a metaphor of Jesus himself. (Fig. 4).

<br/>

In contrast to the original iconographic interplay, the lamb’s
now-trademark facial features are the focus of attention, additionally
emphasized by the green background with the radial golden lines that
draw the gaze to the center of the image. Without its context, the
lamb’s head looks daffy and silly as well as ‘poorly executed’ if
considered simply as an attempt at a mimetic depiction of a sheep.
Accordingly, cropping it down to a square means that the image has been
reformatted to such an extent that its visual impact was completely
modified. The intention behind this strategy is obvious: in cropping the
image to a square portrait, the narrative of an alarming resemblance of
the restored animal to a human face appears visually confirmed.
Moreover, reformatting fosters comparisons to other portraits of meme
icons and thereby manifests the ‘failure’-narrative through comparative
vision alone.[^13chapter11_13] Van Eyck’s sheep is now available in the large pool
of other square portraits to which it can be compared, may it be Kylie
Jenner’s face, or the everyday Insta-girl’s duckface selfie. Through
reformatting, the lamb’s formal properties within its original context
are circumvented and matched to similar images—which have also been
reformatted in their own respect. Just look at the image of Kylie (Fig.
1) and you’ll immediately notice that it actually is a still of a
popular video on YouTube that has been aligned to the Eyckian lamb in
order to enhance the effect of the juxtaposition.[^13chapter11_14] Through
reformatting, van Eyck’s outstanding work has been standardized to such
an extent that it can be swapped with pretty much any other image of
this visual cluster. The user can trade the head of the Mystic Lamb for
a close-up of Shaun the Sheep.[^13chapter11_15]

When looking at the format of the images implemented in the lamb memes,
it is obvious that a certain iconic formula—an archetypal formal pattern
or visual scheme—connects them all. Within it lies the memetic power of
the reformatted image of the Mystic Lamb: every variation of the *Ghent
Altarpiece Lamb Restoration Meme* implements square centered close-up
portraits that recall the omnipresent selfie and its ilk, which are part
of daily communication online. These headshots with their encoded facial
expressions are an essential part of everyday visual literacies of net
culture. As they reappear over and over again, in their familiarity
users are encouraged to remix the components themselves.[^13chapter11_16] For most
of them remixing takes just a minute and they can become part of the
discussion. Reformatting as a visual strategy, therefore, has a bifold
character. On the one hand, it demonstrates the interaction of users
with images as a way of communicating with their online peers. On the
other hand, it highlights the independent existence of the image in its
new form within the visual cluster into which it has been inserted based
on this format.

## Visual Clusters in Network Cultures

Through reformatting, the image of the Mystic Lamb has become part of a
cluster of images gathering around the keywords ‘disturbingly humanoid’
or ‘restoration gone wrong’. The concept of visual clusters is a loose
association of images based on formal characteristics. It describes
their relation to and among each other on a level of content, emotion,
or personal meaning. The idea traces back to the methodology of early
20^th^ century art historian and cultural scientist Aby M. Warburg who
brought together images on large mood boards. These were supposed to
‘illuminate new connections at the level of content, new insights, and
the shifting and transfer of figurative traditions’[^13chapter11_17] and could be
regarded as an early predecessor of Pinterest. Transferring Warburg’s
understanding of how images behave in a cluster structure to the realm
of the internet, Kerstin Schankweiler observes that clustering similar
images which recur on related topics or share a certain set of formal
properties is a widespread way of dealing with images in net
communication. Rather than promoting a specific single image, these
clusters are likely to spawn certain image types so that pretty much any
image of the cluster can be regarded as a representation of all the
others and act in their place.[^13chapter11_18] Within this dynamic, the square
portrait of the restored lamb is absorbed by an image type that recurs
principally on the same subject—the portrait of an ‘alarmingly
humanoid’, ‘poorly restored’ or ‘botched’ face
(\#KylieJennerLipChallenge).

The ways visual clusters form and operate in net cultures greatly depend
on the expectations of community members and the way they are met by
references to a collective cultural memory. Expectations themselves bear
a historicity as they are ‘built through recognition, which requires
some regulated process of repetition’.[^13chapter11_19] They are produced and
manifested over time by a community as they are repeated in everyday
practices of net culture through style, rhetoric, or their modus
operandi. As they are reproduced over and over again, confronting
community members on a daily basis, expectations are not only generated
by the practices themselves, but also by the referentiality to historic
predecessors that resonate within them.[^13chapter11_20] Both the iconic formula of
the square portrait image, and the act of comparative vision seem to
cater to the expectations of the community. Tapping into their shared
memory of pop culture, members playfully remix the lamb’s head. In
relation to the cluster of ‘botched’ or ‘alarmingly humanoid’ headshots,
the comparisons of the Mystic Lamb to icons of meme culture illuminate
new connections beyond the boundaries of the restoration of the *Ghent
Altarpiece*. These comparisons work at the level of content on the one
hand, formal similarities on the other, enabling shifts of historic
traditions, visual expectations, meaning, and—as always—ironic reading
between images.[^13chapter11_21] It is exactly this visual referentiality and formal
relation that makes the ‘disturbingly humanoid’ lamb comprehensible for
the net community. In fact, it is the fair reminiscence of other online
phenomena as well as users’ expectations that allow new readings of the
restoration campaign and the work of art itself.

But what does entering this cluster mean for our mugshot of van Eyck’s
Lamb of God? Let’s finally come back to one of our previous examples:
the initial variation of the *Ghent Altarpiece Lamb Restoration Meme*.
The juxtaposition of the two heads before and after restoration works as
a historical mise-en-scène of two distinctive temporal stages of the
same picture.[^13chapter11_22] The comparison of works of art before and after their
often-astonishing restorations has a long-standing tradition in visual
history and internet culture respectively. Like the infamous *Potato
Jesus* aka *Ecce Mono* (Fig. 5), an internet meme based on the botched
restoration of a 20^th^ century Ecce Homo-fresco by an amateur
conservator in Borja, Spain, that took social media by storm in 2012 and
the many more memes of failed restoration attempts following the same
genre of ‘restoration gone wrong’.

<br/>

The meme compares the before to the two restoration attempts focusing on the face of the Virgin. A comment relates it to the Potato Jesus.](imgs/11.6.jpeg)

<br/>

In its original state, the devotional fresco by Elías García Martínez
showed Christ in a half-length portrait in three-quarter profile placed
on an unrolled scroll, his suffering and lifelike face the center of
attention. After the amateur ‘restoration’ of the artwork the face in
particular looks shockingly beastly. Within a day, countless internet
memes were spawned photoshopping *Potato Jesus’s* revolting face onto
Leonardo’s *Mona Lisa* or the apostles in his *Last Supper*, giving it
teddy bear ears, or simply comparing it to its pre-restoration
counterpart. *Potato Jesus* can be regarded the first and most
influential predecessor of the ‘restoration gone wrong’ genre and is
certainly an icon of meme culture. It was followed by a vast amount of
other internet memes on the topic of ‘failed’ art restorations that all
are somewhat visually related to the restoration fiasco from 2012. Just
search for ‘Potato Jesus’ on *knowyourmeme.com* and you’ll encounter a
large variety of more or less famous cases of ‘failed’
restorations—among them, of course, van Eyck’s Lamb of God. Many of
them, just as is the case with the *Ecce Mono* himself, and in the
initial variation of the *Ghent Altarpiece Lamb Restoration Meme*,
feature before-and-after-comparisons of the artworks in question. What
is remarkable, however, is that they all have one thing in common: They
all focus on (oftentimes square) portraits that are joyfully
photoshopped, remixed, and mockingly labelled (Fig. 6). From the very
beginning, always referencing *Potato Jesus* in one way or another, the
portrait format has been of central interest to memetic jokes on
‘restoration gone wrong’. As *Potato Jesus* is an icon of meme culture,
it is thus not surprising that users immediately drew the connection
between the *Ghent Altarpiece Lamb Restoration* and the *Ecce Mono*
(Fig. 5).

By looking more closely into the visual cluster of ‘restoration gone
wrong’, the memetic power lying within the reformatted image of van
Eyck’s Lamb of God becomes obvious. It shows that the dynamics evolving
from the practice of clustering images in meme culture enable exactly
what Warburg tried to follow when creating his mood boards. That is,
based on formal similarities, images like the mugshot of the lamb are
open to transfers in meaning through which they diversify (or completely
change) their visual arguments and may then be referenced to yet other
images. As part of a visual cluster they are able to leave behind their
original contexts, enter into new ones and represent completely
different concepts of net culture. The Mystic Lamb, for example, even if
it has never been the center of interest to scholars of art history and
admirers of van Eyck’s art, is in its new format not only more
appreciated by net users, but also is no longer read as a metaphor of
Christ. Instead, it is assessed and appreciated primarily based on its
distinctive looks: in net culture, therefore, the restoration has to be
regarded a huge success.
