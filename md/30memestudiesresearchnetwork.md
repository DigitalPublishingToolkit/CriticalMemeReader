# Meme Studies Research Network

**The Meme Studies Research Network** is an international and
interdisciplinary research network for scholars who study memes. Founded
by Idil Galip in November 2020, it aims to bring people together and
foster discussion about memes from various academic fields,
methodological practices, and theoretical standpoints. The main goal of
the network is to collaboratively establish a meme studies canon and
offer researchers an index of resources that centre memes as their main
object of interest. The network lives on multiple platforms - we
maintain a blog, as well as a reading group, resource list and a Discord
server.
