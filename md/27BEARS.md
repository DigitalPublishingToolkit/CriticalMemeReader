# An Ambiguous Utopia 

###The Trans Bears

## Introduction

Our contribution is an experiment in memetic worlding. It explores what
could happen if we generated pluralistic, positive visions as an
alternative to today's vastly nihilistic memescape. Initially, our
attempts to create memes antithetical to nihilism ended up \#wholesome,
and did not necessarily represent a radical or visionary enough
departure from the status quo. To imagine a more divergent shift, we
decided to escape the constraints of the current moment and turned to
worldbuilding, science fiction and futuring techniques to envision
scenarios set in an alternative place and time.

As for a theoretical framework, we found Metamodernism helpful in
thinking beyond static categorization:

> Ontologically, metamodernism oscillates between the modern and the
> postmodern. It oscillates between a modern enthusiasm and a postmodern
> irony, between hope and melancholy, between naivete and knowingness,
> empathy and apathy, unity and plurality, totality and fragmentation,
> purity and ambiguity.[^24chapter23_1]

Usefully, metamodernism allows space for multiplicity and ambiguity - to
think more divergently and less naively about what a 'positive' might
mean in a complex context. In other words, there is never just one
narrative. Life can be absurd and meaningless, but we can still believe
in hope.[^24chapter23_2] It is worth noting that our aim here is not to establish a
telos, nor suggest that we should follow a set path to a preconceived
future. Instead, we hope these ideas might spawn others, beyond the
reach of our own imagination.

We want to acknowledge here that a certain amount of financial
stability, and therefore privilege, was necessary to complete this
contribution. From the outset, the project is therefore limited in
scope. It is a result of the ways of knowing and being of two white,
gender non-conforming people of American and German-American origin.

We tried to include diverse perspectives and collaborators in this
project. However, for the time being, these are limited to our extended
network. Creating a truly pluralistic project would require the addition
of many more contributors. Much like a good meme, we hope it will travel
and provide a loose enough framework to eventually incorporate broader
perspectives.

The Trans Bears

## Prologue

Hello!

Meme Squad here. We decided to share our story as a message of hope, and
as proof that change is always possible even with limited means. This
story centers on internet memeing, a seemingly innocent cultural
phenomenon that brought us together. Memes are funny bits of content
that are remixed and shared online by people. If you think of memes as
tiny bits of cultural DNA then, like us, you might be able to imagine
using them to alter the status quo. We hope you might discover their
radical potential and want to make mischief as we did.

## The Ruins

<br/>

Our Meme Squad met at a time we now refer to as The Ruins. Human and
natural systems were on the brink of collapse. Our societies and
politics were the remnants of violent pasts, built on a logic of
expansion, exploitation, and extraction. Much of our work and leisure
were organized around producing value for corporations. Financial wealth
was the main indicator of success and determined our position in the
social hierarchy.

The circumstances left us exhausted, isolated and alienated—everyone
their own island. Few were imaginative enough to question the narrative
we were fed: that it was easier to imagine the end of the world than the
end of the systems that governed our lives. As apathy grew, irony and
cynicism were normalized in online and offline culture.

<br/>

Still, a scattering of people searched for alternatives. Seeking
connection, we tried to find like-minded others on the Whisper Web, a
substratum of private chat rooms and social platforms just out of sight
of the corporate clearnet. Here, we found each other through positive
memes and cemented our bond by forming a squad.

Soon the Whisper Web was acquired by corporations, and we were forced
further underground. We began using the dark forest, a nascent model of
what would later become the Subaltern Web. Here we met others. The dark
forest was alive with covens of meme witches and wizards, droves of
digital fairies and elves, cabals of dissidents, and many more.

Diverse in counter-cultural identity but united in vision, we
collectivised. We formed a syndicate, and began casting coordinated
memetic spells to jinx the established order. We hexed corrupt
corporations, went troll hunting, and inundated bureaucrats with our
raging semiotic meltdown.

We ridiculed old power, and laid bare that the concepts and systems
invented by humans were impressionable to our resistance and change. Our
signs of resistance attracted others. An intense burst of optimism began
to germinate and fill the narrative void of The Ruins.

## Collapse

Not long after we met, things beyond our control fell apart. Earth's
climate had been changing noticeably throughout our lifetime, and was
now at its breaking point. Erratic weather patterns brought catastrophic
forest fires, floods, and droughts. They led to the collapse of both the
human and ecological systems on which we depended.

Coastline internet infrastructure drowned in saltwater and the rare
earth minerals needed to maintain the physical web became inaccessible.
Large swathes of the clearnet went dark. Unsurprisingly this caused
widespread fear, chaos and confusion. We saw a new digital divide: the
monied, who paid gatekeepers for access to information and goods, and
the poor left with nothing but patchy service hosting unreliable,
ad-littered news sites and communication channels.

<br/>

Our plans to grow an accessible, sustainable internet gained urgency.
We’d laid some groundwork in The Ruins, but the crash took its toll on
us and our network too. After the initial shock, we began working in
local chapters to repair and transfer our infrastructure to solar, hydro
and wind power. The internet memes we were used to became nostalgic
memories. We didn’t have the bandwidth for anything but the most
necessary comms. Still, smuggling lols in with the info quickly became a
thing and we learned to meme offline, in slower and more local forms
that resembled older and more ancient traditions. Most importantly, we
learned to laugh together in person again.

## The Makeshift

We began to adapt and find new ways to operate in The Makeshift, the
decade following the collapse. While the rich walled themselves off in
artificial oases, we found hope and purpose in relinquishing things that
hadn't served us in the past and restoring those that had. We
transformed the Subaltern Web into a distributed commons and, for the
most part, found strength in our differences. Still, rebellion and
insurrections caused damage. We suffered setbacks when rogue ideologues
tried to undermine us from the inside, and endured attacks on our
hardware by troll mercenaries who wanted to repurpose our
infrastructure.

We survived, and the physical and psychological rubble left by the
collapse became fertile ground for hybrid countercultural narratives and
identities. As more of our network returned to life online, semiotics of
The Makeshift were shared using old meme formats. Hopepunk emerged as an
absurdist mash-up philosophy, encoding a culture of care, nurture, and
maintenance into our mischief.

<br/>

As the years passed, the last of the old elite hid in their walled and
now dying gardens. While locked out, we'd come to realize we didn't need
them. They had just been middlemen who estranged us from ourselves and
each other. Necessities were available if we stayed bonded by our
philosophy of nurture. We avoided old monetary currencies wherever
possible and, after significant chaos and suffering, managed to
establish our own distributive support systems, whose success we
measured against earthly vitality instead of growth. We still faced
opposition at times, but even sceptics joined us when they saw we were
thriving.

## Deep Adaptation

After a rocky and generative decade in The Makeshift, we found Deep
Adaptation. While in many ways still reeling, we were freed from old
societal constraints. Propelled by necessity, we studied and learned
from previously marginalized human and non-human voices—forgotten or
disregarded ways of knowing and being. We organized our lives and
technologies around the rhythms and cycles of natural rather than
artificial intelligence.

The Web transformed into an entirely new entity, hosted by sun, wind and
water. Realizing that our networks ran on the same energy sources and
minerals as Earth's ecosystems, we began to wonder if there were ways to
connect human networks to natural ones. We developed an adapter to plug
into mycelium and root networks. Our protocols were then able to develop
memetic code in symbiosis with the natural world. Our self-image shifted
dramatically when we realized we were in essence all part of the same
earthly nervous system. Turns out, natural and cultural DNA is one and
the same thing, and Earth is the greatest memer of all.

<br/>

Of course, many cultures had long known and embraced this. For those who
hadn't, scientific evidence made the difference. Old concepts of the
boundary between self and other dissolved and became obsolete. Once the
loneliest species on Earth, we were now able to understand ourselves as
holobionts: multi-species organisms in constant communion with those in
and outside ourselves. In the present day, we make no distinction
between nature and culture. They have merged into one word: nurture.

## Epilogue

That’s all from us for now. All we’re really saying is that ‘nonsense’
can be an effective counter to hegemonic ‘common sense’. Don’t let the
bullies win. And most importantly: don’t forget to lol together.

If you wanna get in touch, find us @ambigutopia.lol wherever you get
your memes. We’ll try to get back to you through deep time.
