# **Praise Gopod: Weird Tales and Memetic Lore on the WELL**

###Jacob Sujin Kuppermann

## Memetic Prehistory

What is an old meme? It depends on who you ask. On Twitter, accounts
like @OldMemeArchive mostly post memes of a distinctly 2007-2012
provenance—references to MySpace and President Obama abound, and the
most common forms shown are rage comics and demotivational posters.
Similarly, a popular Twitter thread from March of last year from user
[@jil\_slander](https://twitter.com/jil_slander/status/1242567579249623045?s=20)
asked ‘What’s a rly old meme that made u laugh so fucking hard when you
first saw it’—a question that returned responses of similar vintage.[^06chapter4_1]
Yet these memes, no matter how ancient they may appear to twitter users,
are certainly not the *oldest* memes.

Traditional histories of the internet meme typically trace the origins
of the term back to Mike Godwin in 1994, whose *Wired* article ‘Meme,
Counter-meme’ brought both Godwin’s eponymous Law and the very concept
of a meme to the broader attention of the internet public.[^06chapter4_2] But
Godwin’s article refers to his own prior exploits in memetics—he uses
the term but he does not coin it. Godwin may have brought the term to a
wider audience, as *Wired* served as a sort of transitional medium from
self-proclaimed netizens to slightly-less online audiences in the early
90s in the US. But before the term “meme” was widely used in an online
context, there were memes.

Most histories of memes neglect to discuss the period before the 1990s
or do so with hardly any detail at all. In Patrick Davison’s 2012 primer
on the linguistic qualities of internet memes, he briefly discusses the
development of emoticons within Usenet discussions in the early 1980s as
a proto-internet meme, but quickly moves on from the emoticon to discuss
more contemporary memes and image macros.[^06chapter4_3] Similarly, semiotic
analyses of internet culture in more recent years have either mentioned
memes in the 1980s only in passing before moving on to more recent
material, as in Cannizzaro’s work on memes as ‘internet signs’, or have
simply bypassed the area entirely, as in Marino’s work on the
“spreadability” of memes, which includes a list of ‘classic’ internet
memes that begins with 1996’s “Dancing Baby” and ends with 2004’s
“Leeroy Jenkins.”[^06chapter4_4]

The exclusion of 1980s internet/proto-internet memes from contemporary
chronologies of meme history is likely explainable by the lack of
accessible high-quality sources from that period. While Google provides
access to the bulk of Usenet groups from the 1980s via Google Groups,
browsing these discussions from the early 1980s can be difficult due to
both interface issues and the posting of spam messages to old groups in
recent years. Early internet/usenet content is also too overwhelming of
an archival mass to sift through to find the first instances of internet
meme content.

Much as the history/pre-history distinction refers to our access to
written-down historical documents from a period, we can create a similar
category of *internet* prehistory: a period when people on the internet
were participating in discourses that are not currently accessible to
us. Much as the prehistory/history distinction is drawn at different
points of time for different areas, the internet entered its historical
age not all at once but in fits and starts, as different communities
became legible to our current archival practices.

The ancient memes of the 1980s and early 1990s can seem far away—almost
alien—to the modern reader. The communities in which they were formed
are no longer at the center of online life. The general inaccessibility
of historical internet communities shrouds their cultural practices in a
certain obscuring mystique. By looking closely at a meme from this
period of the early internet in a still extant online community from the
1980s, we can demystify early internet memetics and identify key points
of connection between memes present and past.

## Thank *Gopod* for the WELL

Fortunately for archival researchers, not all early internet users swam
in the vast ocean that was Usenet. Some preferred smaller shores—walled
gardens and private networks with less overwhelming amounts of content
to examine. One such example is the WELL, a private message board
that—due to its popularity among *Wired* writers, Grateful Dead fans,
and other members of the Silicon Valley tech world and the broader Bay
Area counterculture—became the archetypal ‘virtual community’ in early
tech evangelist literature.[^06chapter4_5] Unlike many other early online
communities, the WELL survives today. For a monthly fee anyone can join
and gain access to the still-active discussion boards as well as access
the remarkably well-preserved archival posts dating back to the site’s
inception in 1985.

Our ability to access posts from the late 1980s on the WELL allows us to
get a finer-grained look at how memes spread in the earliest days of the
internet. I focus on what appears to be the most pervasive textual meme
found on the WELL: ‘Gopod.’ Originating from a typographical error made
by *San Francisco Chronicle* columnist Jon Carroll, ‘Gopod’ became a
sort of ironic folk deity for WELL users in the late 1980s and early
1990s, replacing the word ‘god’ in the forum’s vernacular.

‘Gopod’ is one of the earliest internet memes that we can still find
records of, and perhaps the first to be used in similar ways to
contemporary verbal memes (for one, its memetic uses resemble those of,
say, President Donald Trump’s tweeting the nonsense word ‘Covfefe’ in
April 2017). It also may be the first case of an internet meme breaking
out of online discourse and into conventional media, as news articles in
publications like the *San Francisco Chronicle* and the *New York Times*
discussed ‘Gopod’ and other similar ‘new words’ found on the WELL as the
most distinctive parts of the WELL’s rapidly developing online
culture.[^06chapter4_6]

The WELL was frequently used as the example *par excellence* of online
communities in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Just as an understanding
of the memes of the 2010s would be incomplete without an underlying
understanding of the cultural norms of Black Twitter or Dank Memes
Reddit, or the memes of the 2000s without an understanding of notable
forums and image boards like 4chan’s /b/ or SomethingAwful, an
understanding of early internet memes is not complete with an
understanding of the WELL—and more specifically, the WELL’s ‘Weird’
conference.

## Tales from the WELL

The WELL stands apart from the other online communities extant in the
1980s for a variety of reasons—its cultural cachet and longevity,
certainly, but also the circumstances in which it was founded and its
mechanisms of internal governance that allowed it to develop a strong
culture. The board was founded in 1985 by a group that included many
involved with the *Whole Earth Catalog*, the influential
counterculture/communalist publication founded in the late 1960s by
Stewart Brand. This common ground differentiated the WELL from other
nascent internet communities, which were generally communities of
convenience where the users were connected solely due to their access to
early online services like Usenet, or service providers like Compuserve.

The ideology informing the WELL’s community structures is best shown in
a set of founding principles that then-editor of *Wired* Kevin Kelly
would recount to Howard Rheingold as part of Rheingold’s [*The Virtual Community*](https://www.rheingold.com/vc/book/2.html), an
anthropological survey of the early 1990s online cosmos that focused
heavily on the WELL. In between notes on the WELL’s business model (it
was to be as close as it could be to free while still being profitable),
Kelly, who was a part of the WELL’s scene by virtue of his editorship of
the *Whole Earth Review*, noted that the key to the WELL’s community was
its ‘self-designing’ nature. In Kelly’s words, ‘The early users were to
design the system for later users. The usage of the system would
co-evolve with the system as it was built.’[^06chapter4_7]

This principle served the WELL well over its first few years, where,
under the salutary neglect of the Whole Earth enterprise, a vibrant
community of a few thousand users would grow. The WELL’s business
records from the period, which are stored in Stanford University’s
Special Collections, rarely discuss the actual goings on within the
WELL’s conferences (think subreddits, or boards within a forum).
Instead, they contend mostly with bringing people into the
WELL—advertisements, free accounts for tech journalists, press releases.
Once they got users to sign on, the WELL’s employees were content to
allow the volunteer “hosts” and pre-existing users of conferences to set
the culture of the community.

So what did the WELL’s culture look like? In many ways, it was not
radically different from the culture of later forums, or even
contemporary discussion boards like subreddits. Like many of these
environments, discussion on the WELL was dominated by power users who
made the majority of comments, with a larger body of lurkers who rarely
commented and mostly just observed. One analysis of posting stats from
early 1994 showed that half of the over 150,000 posts made over a
two-month period on the WELL came from just 99 users, while over half of
the WELL’s users made no posts at all in that same span.[^06chapter4_8]

The WELL’s user base was interested in a variety of topics. Some of the
most popular conferences included hippie mainstays like the environment,
outdoor recreation, and most of all the Grateful Dead.[^06chapter4_9] Yet another
section of the network was made up of tech enthusiasts, with conferences
on cutting edge topics like Hypercard (a popular software development
kit published by Apple), hacking, and virtual reality that also drew
hundreds of unique visitors a month. Most of all, though, the WELL was
interested in the WELL itself.

WELL user Maria Syndicus (username Nana) put it best in an interview
with journalist Katie Hafner, who wrote the only single-topic history of
the WELL: ‘if something didn’t happen on The Well, it didn’t
happen.’[^06chapter4_10] In a directory of the WELL circa 1992 republished in
Rheingold’s *The Virtual Community*, 11 separate conferences relating to
the WELL itself are listed out of a total of 120 public
conferences.[^06chapter4_11]

In those conferences, the users of the WELL debated the state of their
virtual community. In the Policy conference, WELL gadfly Blair Newman
deftly assessed the issue of lurkers vs power users, saying that ‘Well
words should sink or swim on their own merits, but (face it, folks) they
are weighted if they are from sbb, fig, mkapor, jrc, james, metaview
(anti-gravity weighted); and such weightings may aggravate the
lurker/poster ratio problem.’[^06chapter4_12]

The metaWELL, as it was so called, occupied itself with two pastimes:
debating the present/future of the WELL, and chronicling its past for
the sake of those who weren’t there. Unlike more modern online
communities, where new users are often told to simply ‘lurk moar’ in
order to gain cultural competency, the WELL’s old guard reveled in the
recounting of lore to new members of the community. The WELL’s
self-referential quality made it an early online example of what
sociologist Christopher Kelty refers to as a ‘recursive public’. That
is, ‘a public that is vitally concerned with the material and practical
maintenance and modification of the technical, legal, practical, and
conceptual means of its own existence as a public; it is a collective
independent of other forms of constituted power and is capable of
speaking to existing forms of power through the production of actually
existing alternatives.’[^06chapter4_13]

The WELL’s community, in a very real sense, was based on keeping the
WELL itself together. This preoccupation made the WELL fertile ground
for the spread of memes within the platform as its users were always
looking back into themselves, cracking jokes and iterating on the
previous day’s conversation. The conference that perhaps best
encapsulated this ethos—even moreso than the metaWELL boards—was the
Weird conference. Described by Hafner as ‘the Well’s id’ and a
‘free-fire zone,’ the Weird conference was home to what we can now
recognize as a nascent form of shitposting.[^06chapter4_14] The conversations
verged on the absurd, with the only connecting thread being the shared
folklore of cultural references and prior jokes that ultimately led back
to the WELL itself.

In other words, the Weird conference provided the necessary and
sufficient conditions for the development of some of the earliest
recorded internet memes. It’s no coincidence that Mike Godwin cited the
WELL twice in ‘Meme, Counter-Meme’: you can still find his posts from
around that period on the WELL (username Mnemonic), although his user
page expressly prohibits us, or anyone else, from reprinting them.

## Gopod in and out of the Machine

Of all the WELL’s memes, “Gopod” is perhaps the best known. In its
metastasized form, used thousands of times over on the WELL, it refers
to ‘The Supreme Being of the WELL’, a deity to invoke in times of need
or exasperation, but its roots are somewhat more humble. Somewhere in
the Weird conference in March 1988, *San Francisco Chronicle* columnist
Jon Carroll attempted to write ‘Thank God.’ He, of his own admission,
failed, and Gopod experienced its immaculate conception. From there, the
cult of Gopod expanded outward, first to the Mind conference and then to
the community as a whole. This timeline may not be exactly
accurate—there’s one recorded post from a non-Carroll source dated to
January 1988 that contains the word that’s still viewable on the web—but
the general arc of the story remains the same. By early 1989, knowledge
of Gopod was a *fait accompli*: ‘New users just came to understand that
the Well has a higher power and it is called Gopod.’[^06chapter4_15]

Our knowledge of Gopod on the WELL comes from two slightly different
sources. The first is the thousands of viewable posts using the term
made from 1988 to the present day found on the WELL. These give a broad
view of the casual use of Gopod, in topics discussing everything from
AOL to Star Wars to Ross Perot’s presidential ambitions to tips for
amateur boaters. They also give a view into the mutations Gopod went
through in Weird, which served as a sort of cultural bleeding edge for
the rest of the WELL. There, Gopod is not just a banal invocation of the
divine but something more radical. One particularly infamous topic is
dubbed ‘the Nine Billionth Name of Gopod.’ The poster warns that ‘when
we reach 10,000 responses, the world will end.’ Fortunately for all of
us, the topic petered out after a mere 2012 posts, ranging from early
1989 to summer 2000.

But these raw posts do not give us a good window into how Gopod was
perceived as a phenomenon on the WELL. For this, we instead need posts
*about* Gopod. Here, the metaWELL becomes vitally useful. Take the story
of Gopod’s origins—it comes to us direct from the WELL’s archives, from
‘a small attempt at the beginnings of an oral history of the Well’ made
by Carroll himself.[^06chapter4_16] What is perhaps more interesting than any
particular detail of Carroll’s telling is *when* it was made—the
original post of that topic was made on May 15, 1989, scarcely a year
after Carroll’s first post involving Gopod. After just a year, the term
had already worked its way into the vernacular of the WELL to such an
extent that an explanation of its origin was warranted.

Gopod became a certain token of WELL-ness, a symbol of the witty,
irreverent style of the site. In a *New York Times*
[article](https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/28/style/life-style-coming-to-the-east-coast-an-electronic-salon.html)
on a largely unsuccessful east coast clone of the WELL called the Echo,
one user of the WELL is quoted as saying that ‘no one ever refers to God
anymore’ on the WELL—just Gopod.[^06chapter4_17] Similarly, Carroll used his own
typo in a *Chronicle* column in 1993, citing ‘Gopod’ and ‘Bog fu’ (that
is, big fun) as examples of how ‘spelling and language conventions
change rapidly’ on the information superhighway.[^06chapter4_18] You can find
instances of Gopod being referenced here and there on the wider web—on a
Slashdot comment on the news of the WELL’s later sale to Salon in
1999[^06chapter4_19], a Klezmer news blog in 2006,[^06chapter4_20] a tweet from 2018
reminiscing on the WELL.[^06chapter4_21]

In this way, Gopod’s spread outside of the WELL itself presaged two
features of contemporary meme use. The first is the inevitable spread of
memes out of the contexts in which they were created—just as Gopod
migrated from Weird to Mind to the more couth areas of the WELL to the
*New York Times* itself, so do memes now move from 4chan to Twitter to
Reddit to Instagram to Facebook—or in endless combinations of those
online spaces. The other is the use of memes as symbols of identity.
Just as a Redditor in 2010 could identify themselves by saying ‘the
narwhal bacons at midnight,’[^06chapter4_22] or Tumblr users of a similar era could
use the phrase ‘I like your shoelaces’ and the response ‘Thanks, I stole
them from the president’[^06chapter4_23] to winkingly self-associate, a WELL user
in some other corner of the world could simply thank Gopod and see who
would say amen.

## Memes of Future Past

From a historiographical and methodological standpoint, the existence of
the WELL’s archives and other internet sources from the 1980s and 1990s
provides an underexplored angle in meme studies. The historical coverage
of these sources is incomplete, especially relative to more contemporary
records: the WELL’s pre-1986 archives are largely missing due to a
combination of privacy and storage space concerns from the community’s
early days. But even the fragmented records of the early internet
provide insights into the period’s norms of communication, and therefore
should be sought out and used by researchers interested in internet
memes just as much as more modern sources.

On a broader level, the tale of Gopod is helpful in showing that the
earlier eras of the internet are not so alien from our own norms. The
WELL had tens of thousands of users at its peak; Reddit, Twitter, and
Instagram have hundreds of millions. And yet, despite the massive
differences in scale, the posting habits of users on the WELL do not
seem so strange.

It’s a difference in volume but not in form: people joke and debate, and
debate their jokes, and joke about their debates, and joke on their
jokes in an endless procession of conversation. And in 1989 and 2021,
and perhaps onward into the future, memes like Gopod embed themselves
deeply within these discourses, leaving an undeniable mark on the shape
of the communities in which they reside.
