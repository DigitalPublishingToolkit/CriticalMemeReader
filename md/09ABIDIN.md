# **Audio Memes, Earworms, and Templatability: the ‘Aural Turn’ of Memes on TikTok**

###Crystal Abidin and Dr. Bondy Valdovinos Kaye 

‘Audio memes’ popularized by TikTok have become the next frontier of
meme cultures on the internet, presenting an 'aural turn' in meme
ecologies. On TikTok, ‘audio memes’ and the texture of sound take on an
intimate disposition, requiring care, tact, and wit to situate and
decipher: TikTokers often rely on the lyrics of specific songs to tell a
story (e.g. when the lyrics are central to lip syncing, when the
punchline of a video is a specific lyrical line in the song); consider
the musical and rhythmic shape of a tune to advance the storyline of
their video (e.g. when a beat ‘drops’, when a song transitions to ‘bad
recorder playing’); complement or juxtapose audio memes against video
content and textual captions (e.g. song to provide ambience for the
storytelling, song to change the tonality of storytelling to sarcasm or
parody); or organize and streamline content into specific silos.[^07chapter5_1]

In addition to reusing and remixing audio clips and music, TikTokers
also engage with other original audio templates through duets and
replies. In some instances, TikTokers have dedicated accounts to
generate original audio clips with the intention of having others use
them in their videos.[^07chapter5_2] In other instances, TikTokers have
circumvented being ‘catalogued’ or ‘streamed’ into the silos of ‘audio
meme’ templates by strategizing around refusal, manipulation,
soundjacking, and other practices. This has included competitive ‘chart
jacking’ to register higher up in an ‘audio meme’ stream, conflict
around impropriety and ownership of original audio memes, and specific
platform norms around the attention economies of sound on TikTok.

Beyond its instantiations on its home platform, TikTok parlance has
become integrated into everyday practices and become pervasive in social
media pop cultures Let us consider two case studies of ‘audio memes’:
Absofacto's ‘Dissolve’ and Rocky Paterra's ‘I’m An Accountant’, to
understand the role of memes in engaging in tone policing and performing
with mediated identities.

## Evaluating Earworms 

Ever since we started researching TikTok and writing papers and books on
the topic, a new routine that has emerged includes ‘TikTok Old’ friends
coming up to us and going: ‘Hey! What is that TikTok song that goes
*\~\~incoherent humming and tapping\~\~*? Please, I need to know the
title or artist’. 50% of the time, we have literally just watched and
studied 50 of those TikToks ‘For Science’ and can placate our friends’
raging earworms. The other 50% of the time, we stare blankly at our
friends and channel the ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/ vibe with our eyes.

Sound is unique as a memetic medium. Unlike other forms of media, sounds
have ways of getting lodged in our brains as earworms, often holding us
captive and looping on repeat as we go about our day. And then we
unwittingly hum and tap tunes on a bus ride, in a lecture theatre, while
doing the dishes, perhaps much to the disdain of the people around us!
Sounds both fascinate and terrorize us as TikTok researchers with past
lives as musicians—Crystal an orchestral percussionist, and Bondy a jazz
drummer. On the one hand, we are constantly amazed by the talent and
creativity of TikTokers who deploy sounds in the most creative of ways
to convey a variety of messages and intentions. On the other hand, our
friends have now assigned us as the default Human Jukeboxes™ of the
group, all thanks to TikTok.

TikTok is a unique platform to explore how sounds turn into ear worms,
and then into memes. The platform allows users to repurpose existing
audio in new videos with a few taps of the finger[^07chapter5_3], and users can
even search through archives of videos to see how others have creatively
or subversively used and reappropriated specific audio clips. A sneak
peek into the DM (direct message) history between the authors would
reveal countless videos containing catchy songs, clips from popular
media, and other forms of audio clips that have turned into memes on
TikTok. Several of these were accompanied by off-the-cuff commentary
that indicated serendipitous coincidences thanks to TikTok’s algorithmic
recommendations on our FYP or ‘For You Page’ (*‘Homgh! I just saw this
one too!’*), cross-platform flows which signposted that a TikTok meme
was entering a bigger stage of virality (*‘This one is also on reddit
now!*’), and our \~feelings\~ towards such audio memes as trained
musicians and TikTok enthusiasts (*‘This gave me a stroke…’; ‘Idk why my
ears are tinkling?’; ‘I love TikTok 4eva &lt;3’*). We became interested
in understanding why audio was such a major element in these viral
videos and how TikTok prioritizes audio over video.

## Templatability on TikTok 

‘Templatability’ is a concept coined by visual social media studies
scholars Leaver, Highfield, and Abidin[^07chapter5_4] to describe how a combination
of vernacular norms by elite users on a platform (like Influencers) and
algorithmic recommendation systems that value and promote these norms
(by amplifying the content to appear in others’ feeds) result in a
wealth of content that ends up being aesthetically similar.[^07chapter5_5]
Interactions between users and platforms lead to specific aesthetic
choices, ways of crafting content, and strategies of attention grabbing
on social that then become ‘templates’. In other words, both automated
systems that recommend popular content to users, as well as users who
then internalize recommendation logics and try to ‘please the algorithm’
by posting certain types of content lead to such templates. It is a
complex dance to navigate for users to remain visible on the platform to
fellow users via ‘the human eye’, and to the algorithm via ‘the machine
eye’. Monetization models also influence templates by pushing sponsored
content to generate advertising revenues for platforms, or by users with
promotional partnerships incorporating popular templates to make more
money for themselves. Templates allow users a degree of agency to choose
which kinds of scripts they wish to draw from or incorporate into their
own content, while simultaneously limiting originality.

‘Circumscribed creativity’—coined by digital media studies scholars
Kaye, Chen, and Zeng[^07chapter5_6]—builds on the concept of templatability by
adding a ‘call to action’ from other users, or a ‘nudge’ to create from
the platform itself. TikTokers can directly circumscribe creativity by
asking viewers to create content based on a template they are trying to
promote, such as by inviting others to participate in dance challenges.
The TikTok platform also indirectly circumscribes creativity by
suggesting ways to interact with existing content through a variety of
‘platform features’[^07chapter5_7]—these are the interfaces and protocols that
facilitate interactions between people and platforms. There are several
features on TikTok that circumscribe creativity passively, such as
through the main viewing interface, the For You Page (FYP) and its
underlying recommender algorithm. Actively, there are features like
‘duet’ which allows users to create a new video side-by-side the one
they were just watching, ‘stitch’ which allows users to clip a portion
of a previous video and add new content, and ‘use this sound’, which
allows users to import the audio from a video into a new video.[^07chapter5_8]
These features may implicitly guide TikTokers towards certain kinds of
creativity but can also work in concert with explicit calls to action
from other TikTokers who invite audiences to ‘duet this video’ or ‘use
this sound’.

Memes on TikTok capitalize on elements of templatability and
circumscribed creativity to guide TikTokers as they navigate trends and
attempt to boost their visibility. Templates come in all shapes and
sizes, and while they do not necessarily represent cultural norms or
hegemony, they are both easily memorable and highly replicable.[^07chapter5_9]
Popular video memes templates share common characteristics such as being
humorous, simple, replicable, whimsical, and feature voices of ordinary
users.[^07chapter5_10] Circumscribed creativity takes meme templates a step further
by directly or indirectly pushing TikTokers to create memes based on
popular templates. This can be useful for TikTokers struggling to find
new original ideas for a short video, or for TikTokers who would not
normally post content but are encouraged to do so by platform features
and or popular templates.[^07chapter5_11] What makes TikTok’s templatability and
circumscribed creativity all the more curious is its adoption of sound
or audio as the ‘driving template’ and ‘organizing principle’[^07chapter5_12]
through which user actions are massaged and memes are born. As such, we
consider the possibility of the ‘aural turn’ in meme ecologies in the
next section.

## The ‘Aural Turn’ in Memes

Traditionally, scholars who have studied memes have seemed to generalize
them as a visual format, usually delivered as a video, an image macro,
an image, a pictogram, or text-based template exchange. The ways we
locate memes have also been primarily visual: collated under a dedicated
hashtag, congregated in a specific social media group/page or messaging
group, or spreading on the temporally-contingent ‘trending’ lists of
various platforms.

But in the spectacular space of TikTok, memes have taken an ‘aural
turn’. For one, memes are primarily sorted and organized into
‘repositories’ of audio clips available in the ‘use this sound’ feature,
which enables TikTokers to reuse the template clip with a new visual
performance, or ‘embellish’ their creative remix of the template clip
through volume control, additional dialogue, and the like.[^07chapter5_13] The
meta-genres of meme challenges on TikTok also build upon established
catchphrases, with posts beginning with a signature call-out originating
from TikTok, like ‘Put a finger down if you are X’, ‘Tell me you are X
without telling me you are X’, and ‘Hey yo, X check’. In each meme
trend, and indeed in each variation and mutation of the meme trend, the
specific tonality and register of the voicing, and the ambience and mood
of the accompanying music (if any) dictates the call to respond. In
essence, audio memes on TikTok literally reflect the ‘pop
poly*vocality*’, or the ‘pop cultural *common tongue* that
facilitate\[s\] the diverse engagement of many *voices*’.[^07chapter5_14]

In media studies and cultural studies, we often speak of a ‘turn’ in
something when one of these occurs: a sharp pivot in the *focus* of
something, a shift in the *emphasis* of something, the rapid increase in
the *visibility* of something, or a growing *importance* in the impact
of something. The centrality of the ‘audio’ on TikTok encapsulates
exactly this. Trends do not just go viral, they become solidified as
culture, whether ‘TikTok culture’, ‘Gen Z culture’, or ‘social media
culture’. The template of catchphrases as an opening, a meme, or a
call-to-respond has also propagated outside of TikTok, and taken root on
other social media (especially on Instagram due to its TikTok-like Reels
feature), on other digital media cultures at large (especially on the
social media marketing content of various brands targeting young
people), and in everyday vernacular (in our fieldwork and interviews, we
encountered young people who frequently spoke in ‘TikTok codes’ in their
everyday parlance). To be cheeky, this illustrates another meta-meme:
the memefication of TikTok, establishing its native phatic communication
templates, aesthetic preferences, and registers and tonalities as a new
social practice on social media at large.

Audio memes that include words or lyrics are an opportunity for
TikTokers to engage with, or reinterpret, the meaning of songs or audio
clips. TikTokers can engage with the stated meaning of clips to form
communities of practice among groups of people who relate to the message
in the meme.[^07chapter5_15] By reinterpreting or subverting meanings, TikTokers
can use audio memes to expand the relatability of audio memes in
unexpected directions.[^07chapter5_16]

## Absofacto's ‘Dissolve’

Memes are ‘flexible’[^07chapter5_17] objects that can be embedded with variants and
remixes and layers of meaning. For audio memes, this is intensified
given the extensive possibilities enabled by complementing or
juxtaposing the aural against the visual. But what happens when memes
take on fraught meanings and dark innuendos that are refused by the meme
originator, the creator of the content being remixed, or by competing
communities of meme connoisseurs?

Musician Absofacto’s (Jonathan Visger) 2019 song ‘Dissolve’ exhibits the
tensions and complications that arise when meme creators and TikTokers
wrestle over ‘ownership claim\[s\]’ and the ‘unwanted reuse’[^07chapter5_18] of
their content. ‘Dissolve’ was first uploaded onto TikTok in 2019 by
another TikToker as the audio meme ‘original sound – SunriseMusic’,
without its creator Absofacto’s knowledge. The song originally intended
to reflect upon the relationship between a romantic couple, and featured
a chorus with the lyrics:

I just wanted you to watch me dissolve/

Slowly/

In a pool full of your love/

However, by mid-2020, Absofacto reported receiving messages from
TikTokers, concerned fans, and victims of sexual abuse informing him
that the audio clip was being used to accompany ‘daddy-daughter POV’
(point of view) roleplaying, with innuendos of sexual violence and
incest. Following this, Absofacto turned to TikTok to post videos using
the audio meme to push back against this reuse. He tells followers that
his song has been ‘taken over by a gross daddy pov trend’, and in his
caption, pleads for fellow TikTokers to ‘rescue it’ by using it for
‘something else’.

This tone policing demonstrated the unbridled ‘networked publics’[^07chapter5_19]
of meme cultures, wherein originators have little to no control over how
their content is propagated, adapted, or mutated. Absofacto’s call for
help received responses of various silos of TikTokers, as evidenced in a
follow-up post where he thanks users such as ‘“alt tiktok”, “lgbtq
tiktok”, “kpop stans”, and “everyone who doesn’t fit in any group”’[^07chapter5_20]
for using the audio meme to ‘take back’ the narrative-making. This
communal act underscores that meme publics are a ‘social practice’[^07chapter5_21]
that relies on the collaboration of meme creators and audiences. In
subsequent follow-up posts, Absofacto continued to appeal to various
demographics, subcultures, and silos on TikTok to change the tonality of
the audio meme. This resulted in ‘competitive chart ranking’,[^07chapter5_22] where
groups of TikTokers would conscientiously replay specific TikTok posts
in the audio meme in order to raise their ‘engagement rate’, to allow
these new remixes to chart higher in the audio meme stream, in the hopes
of drowning out the ‘daddy-daughter POV’ ones.

While Absofacto’s pleas to the TikTok Safety Team to intervene did not
appear to be answered, the coordinated effort of hundreds of TikTokers
eventually ‘diluted’ the meme stream sufficiently that the audio meme
was no longer solely claimed by NSFW content. While memes have
previously been observed to be a ‘common instrument for establishing
normativity’,[^07chapter5_23] this case study is a masterclass on how the
moralities and tonalities of this ‘normativity’ can be continuously
challenged, reshaped, or corrupted.

## Rocky Paterra's ‘I’m An Accountant’

Rocky Paterra's 2020 song ‘I'm An Accountant’ demonstrates how TikTokers
directly engaged with the lyrics at face value and re-contextualized the
song into a performance of mediated identities. The lyrics of ‘I'm An
Accountant’ are a simple and straightforward representation of Paterra's
real life as an actor and musician in New York:

I'm a struggling actor but if I'm asked by a stranger what I do /

I usually end up telling a lie because there's just too much to get
through /

I don't want to go through the motions of saying that auditioning is a
full-time job /

I'd rather smile and simply state that I have a full-time job /

As an accountant /

The song is an elegy to Paterra's many long and frustrating
conversations with friends and family members trying to understand why a
Broadway actor and singer wasn't going in to an office every day at 9am.
The lyrics also provide easy-to-follow instructions for any others in
Paterra's position who were searching for an easy way out of the ‘What
do you do for work?’ conversation. If someone asks, and you do not want
to ‘get into it’, just say ‘I'm an accountant’ and problem solved!
Surely no one is going to heap follow-up questions onto you with a job
as mundane and straightforward as being ‘an accountant’.

Paterra's original audio and video work as a meme template by being
funny, simple, and relatable.[^07chapter5_24] The throbbing bass and minimal melody
lines are catchy enough to satisfy the earworm requirement for an audio
meme, but the template also includes choreographed line-reading. After
the first verse, the song shifts into a back-and-forth conversation
between the ‘Accountant’ and the person asking too many questions. This
brief dialogic section allows any others using the meme to create
various visual representations of what their ‘accounting job’ entails.
The on-screen text and video caption directly call on ‘all struggling
actors’ to adopt this strategy. Despite being originally being intended
for musical theatre communities, the lyrics of ‘I'm an Accountant’ also
tell a relatable story for those working in non-traditional lines of
work that might be tricky to explain to others in a respectable manner.
(Confession: as young millennials researching social media for a living,
telling elderly relatives at awkward family reunions that we are just
‘accountants’ in the University is way easier than explaining that we
get paid to study TikTok memes…)

One community that quickly embraced the ‘I'm An Accountant’ audio meme
was sex workers on TikTok. Sexually explicit content cannot be posted on
TikTok[^07chapter5_25] but many sex workers can use TikTok to boost their profiles.
Creators have long used the short video format as calling cards to
funnel their followings onto other platforms with more opportunities for
growth and monetization.[^07chapter5_26] In much the same vein, sex workers on
TikTok are free to post SFW (Safe For Work) videos introducing
themselves or previewing their type of content on other NSFW (Not Safe
For Work) platforms, with links in their TikTok profile for any
interested viewers. Representing sex work online can be a radical act,
such as in contexts where it is prohibited by law. In contexts where sex
work is less taboo, it can still evoke annoying questions from friends
and family members who hold misinformed or stereotypical views. ‘I'm An
Accountant’ thus allows sex workers to perform an aspect of their
identity by lip-synching to the enigmatic lyrics paired with their own
playful, creative, and ambiguous visual representations of their work.

In July 2020, the struggle of precarious online labor was very real,
widely relatable, and amplified by a global pandemic. For those who
decided to start an Only Fans page during the pandemic, feeling
uncomfortable sharing can be stressful and anxiety-inducing,
particularly when people start asking prying questions. With audio
templates like ‘I'm An Accountant’ TikTokers can present their existing
or newfound revenue stream on their own terms. The meme is obscure
enough to create plausible deniability to take something that could
otherwise be shameful, and turn it into something playful and silly. As
an added bonus, the template is an effective self-promotional tool to
grow followings on other NSFW platforms.[^07chapter5_27]

## Conclusion 

Much of the extant meme scholarship tends to focus on the visual
elements of memes. Visual memes have been found to foster
community,[^07chapter5_28] construct identity[^07chapter5_29] manage visibility,[^07chapter5_30] and
contribute to social change.[^07chapter5_31] The aural component of internet memes
has received only tangential focus,[^07chapter5_32] despite how heavily some of the
most prominent meme trends of the past decade have relied on the viral
potential of earworms and catchy tunes, such as the Harlem Shake[^07chapter5_33] or
the infamous Rickroll.[^07chapter5_34]

The platform features and cultures of TikTok facilitate the use of sound
in unexpected and effortless ways, especially when mobilised as a trend.
Unexpected, because the primary mode of content consumption on TikTok is
through the algorithmically curated FYP, and the sheer volume of content
makes searching for specific sounds or videos difficult. As a result,
new sounds, earworms, or audio memes are discovered spontaneously and
benefit from being instantly appealing and widely recognizable.
Effortless, because TikTok circumscribes creativity to users and places
sound on the same pedestal as visual effects, filters, and hashtags, in
addition to the ‘Use This Sound’ feature. As such, the platform strongly
encourages users t creatively employ audio as they would any other type
of effect or hashtag.

Like other forms of viral content, memes can become disconnected from
their creators.[^07chapter5_35] TikTokers increasingly wrestle over the ownership
of memes and meme ideation, which is distinctive from the prior ethos of
spreadability online, one of the essential components of successful
memes.[^07chapter5_36] TikTok meme creators join the growing ranks of other online
creators seeking credit and acknowledgement for their ideas,[^07chapter5_37]
especially in instances where the sounds being used are more personal,
such as a person’s voice that is being reappropriated or separated from
them in subsequent videos; a practice made possible through three taps
of the finger on TikTok.

The aural turn in memes builds on a format that is still inherently
multimodal. Short video memes on TikTok often feature audio interspersed
with video plus text and create humorous effects that catch on through a
combination of these three elements. It is the layering of audio or
earworms that creates a unique legacy by making short video memes
spreadable and legible. At the same time, it is important to consider
what the harmful potentials of such audio memes are, such as audio clips
that go viral without proper credits to the original creators, or the
use of others’ voices to bully or harass others. Still, audio memes may
also offer bright prospects to aspiring musical artists on TikTok who
can leverage audio memes to initiate new collaborations or professional
opportunities in the music industry.
