# **‘A Vaguely Erotic Mime’: Mimetic Text vs. Optical Tactility**

###Sabrina Ward-Kimola

TikTok dances assemble various fragments—music, human bodily rhythms,
platform infrastructures—towards an imitative end. The imitative body
within this assemblage is no novel development; it has moved to the
collective rhythms of Saturday night tango and the warehouse rave. Even
in a pandemic, Club Quarantine has been a place for bodily togetherness,
divided by the margins of a grid.[^05chapter3_1] The body desires movement and it
desires rhythmic unity. This innate desire to imitate is central to the
TikTok body’s forward momentum, its platformed desire. A jittering scion
of recorded mimetic short videos, the TikTok dance presents bodily unity
bounded within platform protocols. Take, for example, the infamous
TikTok translation of Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion’s choreography
from their ‘Wet Ass Pussy (WAP)’ music video: the first line, ‘from the
top/make it drop’ is accompanied with air splits/low squat, followed by
the widely censored ‘that’s some wet ass pussy’ on cue with rhythmic
twerking supported by outstretched limbs. Within a month of WAP’s
release, 200,000 TikTok users had posted a video of themselves
performing the same routine.[^05chapter3_2]

Despite its antecedents, the TikTok dance’s particular assembly of
cultural phenomena is both uncanny and novel. While it is simply a dance
that can be learned virtually, it is also a massively-propagated and
circulated media object: a ‘vaguely erotic’[^05chapter3_3] form that expands
outwards at staggering scale from a central node, or ‘original’ video
posted by TikTok celebrities like @addison.re or @charlidamelio. While
they appear to take on processes familiar to memetic logics (i.e. they
are widely propagated and shared on and across platforms), TikTok dances
maintain their form without transmutation, seemingly impermeable to the
trolls, deep friers and various third-party remixers that have
historically characterized imageboard meme culture.[^05chapter3_4] As a kinetic,
mimetic and viral object that resists evolution, the TikTok dance is
part participatory internet culture part hypodermic needle: although it
*looks* very much like a meme, it doesn’t *act* like one. While it
circulates at scale, as a distinct video file, it resists reuptake and
remixing. In light of these tensions, I read TikTok dances through a
critical lens of mimesis. I contextualize this within the conditions
through which TikTok replicates sameness in a way that extinguishes the
possibility for variation embedded in memetics as normally understood.

As distinct from Shifman’s definition of memes as ‘units that propagate
*gradually* through interpersonal contact’,[^05chapter3_5] the TikTok dance
functions less as the networked creativity of memetic publics and more
as what Zulli and Zulli call ‘imitation publics.’[^05chapter3_6] To draw out what
in TikTok’s mimesis nullifies this memetic logic, I turn to Walter
Benjamin’s concept of the mimetic faculty, loosely defined as the
process through which one reverses perspective through an imitation of
the Other. Central to the mimetic faculty is imitation as an
undetermined and continual becoming that can only aspire towards, but
never fully meet the object of imitation. I conclude with a discussion
of the “phenomena of dance as something inherently bound to the
social”[^05chapter3_7] and reorient the significance of the TikTok dance as a
cultural form worthy of further analysis.

In ‘Extending the Internet meme: Conceptualizing technological mimesis
and imitation publics on the TikTok platform’, Diana and David James
Zulli argue that TikTok’s algorithm (the ‘For You’ page), organization
procedures and user-oriented video tools extend the internet meme to the
level of platform infrastructure.[^05chapter3_8] Using Light et al.’s walkthrough
method, the authors point to the way that the sign-up page, logics of
categorization (i.e. dance videos organized around a single song), and
user norms such as reactive and narrative imitation, coalesce to produce
so-called ‘imitation publics’.[^05chapter3_9] Defined as ‘a collection of people
whose digital connectivity is constituted through the shared ritual of
content imitation and replication’, imitation publics take form through
mimetic processes that TikTok encourages: the habitual imitation of
bodies constituted by and through TikTok’s protocols.[^05chapter3_10] Zulli & Zulli
point to TikTok’s entire machinery as a mimetic text: the platform
governs through a series of technical arrangements that condition
habitual regimes of user production. Mimetics thus becomes enshrined in
the avenues of possible action by directing the potential unfolding of
resulting media objects.[^05chapter3_11] This mimetic logic also extends beyond the
TikTok platform, as the easily accessible share buttons allow the video
to overflow onto other platforms while still maintaining its shape.
After all, how does one edit a video once it has already been packaged
and compressed into a shareable file size on WhatsApp, Instagram, or to
the lucky recipient of a text message?[^05chapter3_12] The *public* of an imitation
public expands into the domain of adjacent platforms through the very
infrastructures that both enclose and open the viewing and sharing of
content in particular ways. There is no reuptake, no mixing; inscribed
with a watermark, the mimetic TikTok is maintained as an impermeable
copy both in form and potential bodily uptake. Given the relative
novelty of TikTok as an object of scholarly gaze, Diana and David James
Zulli’s analysis provides a valuable departure point from which to think
about the burgeoning role of TikTok in online cultural spaces. Their
analysis also presents an opportunity for further teasing of a loose
distinction between mimetic and memetic, which elides their mutual
constitution. Simply put, mimesis is the mediated imitation of phenomena
(or the Other); it is an interpretation of nature through the tools that
enable the production of art and culture. Because the imitation of forms
beyond our grasp can never be fully achieved, to render it is to create
something new. Consequently, there is the evolution of forms that
constitute the flows of cultural unfolding – for our purposes here, this
is the meme.

As the clock struck 2013, Limor Shifman
emerged from the ninth circle with foreknowledge of memetics to come:
firstly, it is a unit of cultural information that eventually scales
into a macro-level social phenomenon; secondly, it is a unit of cultural
information that is repackaged through mimicry and remix; finally, it is
a unit of cultural information that competes for attention.[^05chapter3_13]
Together, Shifman attributes these coalescing processes to memetic
motion. TikTok enables the seamless circulation of content at scale
through a logic of organization that manifests as the grouping of
content based on the sound or song included in the video. Zulli & Zulli
also point to how the logic of competition is embedded within these
sound/song tags, with the most popular videos sorted at the top of the
page.[^05chapter3_14] It is this exact infrastructural influence Zulli and Zulli
identify that makes TikTok videos something alike but not identical to
the meme: TikTok deviates from Shifman’s second criteria through these
pre-articulated channels of remixing. A privilege revoked from a
potential memetic public, the act of remixing has already been
determined by the platform. This predetermination is reinforced both by
the conditions within which one can create content (a fixed suite of
video editing tools), and habitual regimes of TikTok’s userbase who
yearn for visibility (often manifesting in the aesthetic *du jour*), in
addition to the spectral algorithm of the ‘For You’ page. It is because
of these predetermined streams of mimetic output that Zulli & Zulli
describe TikTok as a mimetic text, in and of itself.

<br/>

To conceive of TikTok as a mimetic text complicates the role that
mimesis has traditionally played in the continual unfolding of memetics.
Originating from a central source or node that has maintained virality
because of its position in the sound/song tag (i.e. the most popular WAP
TikTok dance), the cascade of subsequent TikTok dances resemble cultural
processes somewhere between mass communication, characterized by a
single broadcast, and participatory internet culture as a model of
culture that ‘sees the public not as simply consumers of preconstructed
messages but as people who are shaping, sharing, reframing, and remixing
media content in ways which might not have been previously
imagined’.[^05chapter3_15] Units of popular culture (i.e. Addison Rae’s WAP dance)
are widely imitated, but not for long; TikTok’s infrastructural
conditioning of mimetic possibilities restricts the imitation public
from going beyond a threshold of similarity. While imitation publics are
built upon the production of new content, there are no new forms: they
are but an echo originating from a central source, or ideal image. The
TikTok dance shines bright and fades quickly. WAP is already ancient
history.

As the mimetic text of TikTok makes clear, mimetics are at once a
process and a representation. TikTok mimesis exploits an assemblage of
working pieces (algorithm, organization, user norms) to produce an
aesthetic output that echoes a central ideal image as given *by*
TikTok’s algorithmic production of culture – the top three WAP videos on
the sound/song page. The novelty of TikTok lies in the automation of the
mimetic process formerly taken up (to varying extents) by online users.

To reveal this processual distinction, I turn to Walter Benjamin’s
mimetic faculty. It can be described as: miming, or the mirroring of
representation through a likeness; imitation; the inspiration to proceed
in like-kind; and replication, to produce a material copy.^11^
Benjamin’s interest in the mimetic faculty centered around the desire
and capacity for humans to ‘become and behave like something else’[^05chapter3_16].
Benjamin scholar Michael Taussig expands on this definition and presents
mimesis as ‘the nature that culture uses to create second nature, the
faculty to copy, imitate, make models, explore difference, yield into
and become Other’[^05chapter3_17]. This capacity is contingent upon sensuous
probing, as a copying or imitating something requires a ‘palpable,
sensuous, connection between the very body of the perceiver and the
perceived’.[^05chapter3_18] Benjamin even goes so far as to describe the mimetic
faculty as ‘the gift of seeing resemblances’.[^05chapter3_19] The key point here is
that the desire to imitate and the ‘gift’ of the capacity to sense
resemblances produce an enactment of similarity, or mimesis. Because the
human cannot *be* something else, they can only articulate similarity
through the tools at their disposal (i.e. the paintbrush, the alphabet,
a flute, vocal chords, the body). Through these mediated enactments, the
subject aspires to *become* something else.

In *Doctrine of the Similar,* Benjamin writes that ‘neither the mimetic
forces nor their objects, i.e., the objects of imitation, have remained
the same, unchanged over the course of time’.[^05chapter3_20] This underscores
phylogenesis as central to memetic behavior. Revealing itself over time,
phylogenesis is the iterative mutation of form as a chain of memetic
agents render their interpretation of an object. Due to factors that are
dependent on context – relations between the object and imitating
subject, the tools, the specific quality of the interpretation, to name
a few – there will always be a gradual change of form. As is made
evident in the evolution of the internet meme, the memetic process at
scale dislocates the ‘original’ form (which in our case refers to the
first instance of its emergence as a social phenomenon), effectively
priming it towards a multiplicity of possible articulations. While the
various processes involved in the coagulation of a given form at a
moment in time are not visible, they are central features in the
potential of that form. For this reason, the curation of our tools of
mimetic enactment towards a particular output (exact bodily movements)
within a demarcated space (the bounded TikTok video often unwieldly to
share) ruptures Benjamin’s mimetic process that would yield an infinite
multiplicity of potentials. TikTok’s communicative conditions, or
mimetic text, pre-empts form, retaining the TikTok dance as a bounded
entity.

Although Benjamin points to the potential for objects (namely modern
optical media) to support the mimetic faculty, Taussig extrapolates from
Benjamin’s *One Way Street* to suggest the discussion of mimesis begin
at the (gestating) body. Describing the ‘womb as mimetic organ par
excellence’[^05chapter3_21] Taussig points to the relationship of a child to their
parent as first one of ‘reproduction as replication’ and further, one of
*optical tactility*, with the child yearning to ‘hold the object \[that
is its parent or other desired form\] at very close range by way of its
likeness, its reproduction’[^05chapter3_22]. From this early age, the gazing,
porous ego desires to become that which with they are in relation, a
process through which the young child begins subjectivation – the
realization of themselves as a subject distinct from the Other. From
this moment arises Taussig’s concept of optical tactility, defined as
the relationship between vision and imitation of the Other. This concept
enables a processual way to think through memetics in the online space,
where visuality is a central sensorial contact. Drawing from William
James’ description of the self, Lisa Blackman refers to the ‘capacity of
bodies to acquire more and more connections to artefacts, techniques and
practices’[^05chapter3_23] through any means of sensorial contact. As a process
that connects the body to a continual flow of ‘outer’ possibilities,
optical tactility opens up a method of thinking the body as a process in
relation to objects of imitation and media technologies, as opposed to
the body as a bounded, sovereign entity.[^05chapter3_24] Blackman draws a
distinction between bodies in composition, or bodies as always in the
making, and the molar body which has been pre-formatted to a
teleological end.[^05chapter3_25] The body as inscribed within TikTok’s mimetic
text pre-figures the body’s articulation towards a definable end,
foreclosing any potentiality as informed by an assemblage of interacting
agents (objects, practices, techniques, artefacts, and so on). The
mimetic process as it unfolds on TikTok is best characterized as
fabricating a placeholder for an ‘any \[body\] whatsoever’[^05chapter3_26] that
precludes meaningful[^05chapter3_27] contact and articulation.

We might be best to conclude by situating the TikTok body within the
compositional futures articulated by choreographer-writer duo, Kasia
Wolinkska and Frida Sandström. Their collaborative project, entitled The
Future Body At Work, points to the ways:

> The institutionalization of dance has developed hand in hand with
> ruling structures. Similar to what is inscribed onto the body at work
> or in war, through city architecture, and the organization of the
> nation-state, dance enables control and submission. Yet the very same
> methods used to control the body can be used for the opposite… Through
> an ongoing practice of scored and informed dance gatherings, we want
> to bring attention to how space is distributed and how we constitute
> it with others. In between words and movements, our social
> conditioning is put to work. We bring attention to how space is
> transformed through individual decisions and how listening can precede
> acting, how contraction gives space for release.[^05chapter3_28]

Wolinkska and Sandström see the moving
body as a site of potential that can be controlled and exploited as a
means to a definitive end. Often in the interests of representation, the
‘reigning body absorbs the body of the ruled’[^05chapter3_29] a bodily relationship
famously represented on the front cover of Thomas Hobbe’s 1651 text,
*The Leviathan.* Rather than a site of relation, enactment and continual
becoming, the ruling power facilitates placeholders for the infinitely
replaceable, symbolic body. At the same time, the authors posit the body
as a terrain of *process* that can possibly be resuscitated as a space
where ‘feeling bodies burst beyond their representations’ [^05chapter3_30]. Lisa
Blackman suggests that the processual, dancing body not as ‘isolated,
singular, or molar \[but\] requires a conjoining with others, human and
non-human.’[^05chapter3_31] While the body in relation to the online space is not
completely foreclosed, the architecture of TikTok’s mimetic text
attempts to automate the memetic process, historically central to a
relational becoming through the Other. Yet this very automation
undermines the destabilization of the self-image in this process,
reducing it to a tightly controlled development of mere representation.
Through the lens of Benjamin’s mimetic optical tactility, we see a
margin of slippage between representational and processual memetics that
imparts immeasurable effects to the potentialities of future forms. To
speak of an imitation public through the optical lens is to speak of the
virtualized body as a means to a massively-scalable end in the interests
of more and more content.

While I am skeptical of the ‘revolutionary’ potential of a
hypothetically *becoming* body identified by Wolinkska and Sandström, it
may be true that cultural innovation, i.e. the embrace of difference,
enables an exit from the neoliberal grasp on the tools of our art and
culture.[^05chapter3_32] To offer a lukewarm conclusion, I now bring your attention
to a recent tweet by Spike Magazine’s Deak Kissick, similarly reflecting
upon our apparent state of cultural paralysis:

> We’re trapped in the world Frederic Jameson foretold, ‘a world in
> which stylistic innovation is no longer possible, all that is left to
> imitate dead styles, to speak through the masks and with the voices of
> the styles in the imaginary museum.’ But I know there are ways
> out.[^05chapter3_33]
