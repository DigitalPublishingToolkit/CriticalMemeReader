# **Ibiza Austrian Memes: Reflections on Reclaiming Political Discourse through Memes**

###Anahita Neghabat

On 15 October of 2017, for the first time in almost twenty years,
Austrian citizens elected a far-right government, consisting of a
coalition between the Christian-conservative Austrian People’s Party
(ÖVP) and the far-right Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ). What followed
the election of this unholy unity were two years of racist and
antisemitic scandals, anti-Muslim policies and political rhetoric, a
considerable backlash in feminist politics and a series of attacks on
worker’s rights. Many of these political measures, as well as the shift
in political rhetoric and the normalization of outright racist
‘opinions’ in public discourse, ended up having a lasting effect.

Even as a child, I distinctly remember frustration and anger about
politics and my eagerness to speak up and change something. When I was
twelve, the far-right FPÖ once left an election campaign booklet in our
post box and I—foreshadowing what I am now doing as an anthropologist
and activist—took it upon myself to dissect it in the form of several
pages of meticulous analysis. In my teens, I went to protests on the
weekends behind my parents’ backs, even skipping school once to secretly
travel to a protest in another city. As you can see, I was angry, but I
was also active. This, however, slowly but surely changed after the
election of the far-right government in 2017. I attended the protests
that others somehow still found the energy to organize, but I had a hard
time following the news and actively engaging with politics. My anger
felt heavier and eventually turned into exhaustion. Matters only got
worse when I moved to Budapest in January 2019 for a term abroad at the
Gender Studies Department of the Central European University. *The*
Central European University that far-right authoritarian prime minister
Viktor Orbán soon forced out of Hungary through acts of legal warfare,
one of which included effectively banning gender studies as a discipline
in the whole country. So, there I was in this country that leftists in
Austria had been raising as a cautionary example of what Austrian
politics could easily become for years. There I was, at this university
under attack, studying gender studies when it was no longer accepted as
a discipline. And all news I got from Austria at the time was horrible:
legal introduction of 12-hour workdays, headscarf bans and drastic
reductions of welfare benefits, just to name a few.

But then—in these very dire circumstances—something unforeseen happened.
On 17 May 2019, two German newspapers published video recordings of our
then vice chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache and a younger politician,
both from the far-right FPÖ. The videos depicted Strache in a villa on
the party island Ibiza discussing dubious, potentially corrupt deals
with a woman who had tricked him into believing she was the niece of a
rich oligarch. The whole thing was a set-up, including hidden cameras
and loads of vodka infused with Red Bull (possibly Austria’s most famous
invention). Heinz-Christian Strache was forced to resign and only a few
days later chancellor Sebastian Kurz had to announce new elections. Even
though I knew that right-wing voters, discriminatory systems, and racist
beliefs had not just disappeared overnight, there was an overwhelming
feeling of joy at the time—and hope. I was in Vienna that weekend and
the collective relief I experienced was unbelievable. People were
protesting, hugging, and singing—and making memes. Loads of amazing
memes. Their memes inspired me, so, in the spur of the moment, I
downloaded a random meme-making app and, because I didn’t want to flood
my private Instagram stories with countless memes, I spontaneously
created a meme account: @ibiza\_austrian\_memes.

![Fig. 1: One of my first memes posted on @ibiza\_austrian\_memes in the first couple of days following the Ibiza-scandal. It depicts former vice
chancellor and FPÖ leader Heinz-Christian Strache and former FPÖ politician Johann Gudenus, who were both filmed on Ibiza. Both are smiling and giving a thumbs up. The text reads, ‘When people have 12-hour shifts because of you but you are unemployed’, referring to the loosening of labor laws and introduction of a 12-hour workday by the ÖVP-FPÖ government in 2018.[^14chapter12_1]](/Users/c.c.arkenbouthva.nl/Documents/GitHub/CriticalMemeReader/imgs/12.1.jpeg)

<br/>


What started as a small idea quickly grew into a big project. After only
two days of posting, I already had 5000 followers and it became apparent
that I could use memes as a powerful activist tool for political
commentary. While my following grew, my online activist practice
continually evolved into what it is now. Today, I have about 24 thousand
followers, consisting of a diverse audience of many young people, even
school students, but also journalists, activists, NGOs, and politicians
(with our new vice chancellor perhaps being the most prominent one[^14chapter12_2]).
In my online unpaid activist work, I use memes as a visual vocabulary,
medium, and tool to comment on Austrian political daily news. I aim at
doing so from an intersectional feminist, anti-racist and
anti-authoritarian perspective. Eventually, however, my memes of course
always represent *my* perspective, which is rooted in my biography and
identity. As part of my practice, I mostly *create* but sometimes also
*curate* memes that users send me and post them along with concise texts
contextualizing each meme. These texts in the captions provide
background information (along with source references) and offer critical
perspectives in preferably accessible language. I aim at using short
sentences, visually structure my captions with emojis, and explain
certain political terminology. In addition, I briefly describe the
memes, ensuring accessibility for people who are using text-to-speech
apps, due to visual impairment or other reasons. I have also been using
Instagram’s story tool[^14chapter12_3] to engage with topics more thoroughly, to
provide information about protests or to share other educators’ and
activists’ content. Another big part of my online practice is what is
often referred to as ‘community management’: replying to messages,
moderating comments, deleting hate-speech, and replying to problematic
comments, even providing sources for the facts I build my arguments on
in my replies.

## Shaping Public Discourse with Memes: When Mainstream Media Sucks

I think one of the reasons my memes resonate with so many people is that
by analyzing Austrian interior politics from an explicitly anti-racist
and intersectional feminist perspective, I take a stance that is not
commonly taken in Austrian mainstream media and political discourse.
While there are some journalists, publishers and magazines that are
important exceptions here, a large portion of the influential actors
shaping Austrian public discourse (re)produce hegemonic, often sexist,
racist, classist or otherwise marginalizing and violent views. Sometimes
media uncritically reproduces problematic arguments, generalizations,
and vocabulary in an effort to report ‘neutrally’, thus contributing to
and manifesting shifts in discourse. In these cases, I often
deliberately use memes to problematize terminology or arguments. My aim
is to thereby intervene in public discourse by disrupting the
reproduction of discursive elements.

A good example for this is my meme-criticism of the problematic and
historically inaccurate term ‘Judeo-Christian’. In recent years
right-wing conservative and extremist politicians have increasingly been
using this term to describe Europe’s ‘identity’ or ‘cultural heritage’,
often adding that this heritage and identity shall be ‘protected’ from
societal changes due to immigration. November 2019 at the European
People’s Party congress in Zagreb ÖVP leader Sebastian Kurz—Austrian
chancellor until the Ibiza-scandal and chancellor quickly again after
the new elections—emphasized that the EU commission should ‘protect
Europe’s Judeo-Christian \[*christlich-jüdisch*\] identity and
enlightenment’, adding that Europe should not allow more immigrants than
it could ‘integrate’.[^14chapter12_4] Although the Austrian newspaper *Kurier* put
Kurz’ remarks in quotation marks, the notion of a European or Austrian
‘Judeo-Christian identity’ was not problematized, let alone
criticized.[^14chapter12_5] So, I made a meme.

The meme depicts cartoon character SpongeBob Squarepants, who stands for
chancellor and ÖVP leader Sebastian Kurz. He is reading a book of which
one side is blue and the other one red and is looking at it cross-eyed,
each eye looking at one side. The blue side addresses the regular
occurrence of antisemitic scandals during the ÖVP-FPÖ governing period,
most often caused by FPÖ politicians.[^14chapter12_6] It reads, ‘Forming a coalition
with the right-wing extremist FPÖ, which is mass-producing antisemitic
scandals.’ The red side reads part of the abovementioned Sebastian Kurz
quote, ‘We must protect the Judeo-Christian identity.’ The color-split
of the book visually indicates a contradiction between the two
statements. The meme therefore not only depicts chancellor Sebastian
Kurz as a politically inconsistent actor, but even as a hypocrite who on
the one hand claims to protect a ‘Jewish identity’ but is on the other
hand willing to build a politically opportune alliance with antisemitic
political actors. SpongeBob’s expression is also funny: He looks
confused, lost and even a little desperate. The meme thus also belittles
Sebastian Kurz, his actions and political rhetoric by ridiculing it.

![Fig. 2: A meme depicting cartoon character SpongeBob Squarepants. It criticizes chancellor Sebastian Kurz’ use of the term ‘Judeo-Christian’. The meme was made and posted by me on the Instagram page @ibiza\_austrian\_memes.](/Users/c.c.arkenbouthva.nl/Documents/GitHub/CriticalMemeReader/imgs/12.2.jpeg)

<br/>

Along with the meme, I wrote a caption with which I contextualized and
criticized the term ‘Judeo-Christian’ by pinpointing several problematic
aspects: first, insisting on a ‘Judeo-Christian’ European or Austrian
‘identity’ is simply historically inaccurate. Jews in Europe have been
persecuted and killed by Christians for centuries and are still
marginalized to this day. Austria has an especially gruesome history of
National Socialism and genocide: in its database, the *Documentation
Centre of Austrian Resistance* lists 64 *thousand* Austrian Jews who
fell victim to the Holocaust.[^14chapter12_7] Postulating the existence of a
‘Judeo-Christian’ Austrian identity erases this violent history.
Second—just like in the abovementioned Sebastian Kurz example—the notion
of a ‘Judeo-Christian identity’ is often deployed in anti-immigration
and more specifically anti-Muslim discourses, in which immigrants are
discursively othered and framed as Austria’s ‘real’ antisemitism
problem.[^14chapter12_8] This framing of Orientalized, supposedly ‘Muslim’
immigrants as perpetrators not only discursively distracts from the fact
that they are marginalized and affected by anti-Muslim racism, but it
also erases Austria’s National Socialist history and antisemitic
present.

Using memes, which are enjoyable and quickly readable, as the central
medium for voicing my criticism enables me to reach a lot of users, many
of whom then proceed to read my written commentary and analysis in the
caption. As Anastasia Denisova phrases it, memes are ‘simple’, which
helps to reach broad audiences. At the same time, however, they are
still ‘sufficiently sophisticated to stimulate critical thinking.’[^14chapter12_9]
By making the meme above, I deliberately and strategically disrupted
public political discourse with an aim to inhibit the normalization of
the abovementioned right-wing discursive strategy and anti-Muslim trope.
Because hegemonic media and political discourses marginalize anti-racist
and other anti-discriminatory perspectives, I—and many other
activists—use the online platform Instagram as a space, and memes as a
tool, to publicly share our perspectives and narratives. Denisova argues
that ‘\[w\]hen users share memes on political subjects, they intervene
in the media discourse. They can promote or confront the hegemonic
interpretation of the events; they can suggest an alternative
interpretation; they can present an event in a specific context that
would be educational for others.’[^14chapter12_10] I fully agree: memes are often
used as an accessible medium to share one’s (experiential) knowledge and
therefore also serve a purpose as accessible, easily comprehensible
educational material. One user left a comment under the abovementioned
SpongeBob meme that highlights this educational element: ‘Thanks for the
amazing post, learned something new again.’ Accordingly, my meme page
@ibiza\_austrian\_memes, which I would have previously labelled
satirical political activism, has also been perceived as educational
work and even been discussed in an art education research context
before.[^14chapter12_11]

At first glance, it might seem like this is *just* the meme-maker
telling her story. However, this is not the case. As Limor Shifman
reminds us, memes are intrinsically tied to practices of copying,
imitation, and remixing. She writes, ‘the term \[meme\] describes
cultural reproduction as driven by various means of copying and
imitation \[…\] \[U\]ser-driven imitation and remixing are not just
prevalent practices: they have become highly valued pillars of a
so-called participatory culture.’[^14chapter12_12] From my own experience I know
that users interact with the meme-maker in various ways, inevitably
influencing their practice. The reach of each meme depends on users’
willingness to press the like-button and share it. Liking my memes,
commenting, sharing them with *added* commentary, sending in their own
memes, and re-using templates I made are therefore all practices of
*collectively* creating political narratives online. Moreover, making
memes online often translates to offline relationships. At this point, I
cannot count the number of politically involved people I got to know
through my memes. Online meme practices therefore also shape offline
political activities and alliances.[^14chapter12_13]

## Shaping Public Discourse with Memes: When Sucking Is Institutionalized 

In the example above, media uncritically reproduced elements of a racist
discourse while trying to report ‘neutrally’. Often, however, hegemonic
power relations are also upheld and reproduced when journalists and
other public figures *do* take a stand. As we know, societal power
relations and mechanisms of discrimination are institutionalized.
Political actors therefore often become influential *because of*—not
despite—the fact that they represent hegemonic views. At the same time,
unequal social structures stifle the careers, social participation, and
discursive power of people belonging to marginalized groups. In this
context, social media and memes—which can easily be made and widely
shared by anyone with a smartphone and internet access (and an
understanding of digital culture)—are used by marginalized people to
(co-)create and share their own narratives and truths.[^14chapter12_14] As Emilie
Lawrence and Jessica Ringrose show in their study about feminist humor
online, people ‘are turning to social media sites to make visible
marginalized voices and bodies, either through amplifying the stories of
others or through drawing attention to their own experiences.’[^14chapter12_15]
Sometimes these stories are shared educationally with a wider public,
sometimes they are addressed to people directly affected by the same
kind of oppression, and sometimes both. The meme below was posted on the
Instagram page @migraobservations, a page that belongs to the second
category. @migraobservations describes itself as ‘making memes for the
self-healing from the Migra-trauma in an Alman-society’.[^14chapter12_16] Their meme
below humorously addresses a painful truth for many people of color, who
know what it feels like to be racially profiled and unrightfully
suspected of being up to something dangerous.

![Fig. 3: Posted by @migraobservations on Instagram. The meme consists of stock photos showing a person who is protecting their purse and making dramatic faces and gestures that can be read as ‘stop’ or ‘leave my purse alone’. The text reads: ‘How I’m holding my bag when Almans sit down or walk next to me, in the hope of inciting a reflection of their racism through my ingenious experiment’.](/Users/c.c.arkenbouthva.nl/Documents/GitHub/CriticalMemeReader/imgs/12.3.jpeg)

<br/>

Marginalized groups are of course not only using memes, but also more
conventional media formats to partake in public discourse. There is an
endless quantity of blog entries, online magazines, and even online talk
shows highlighting marginalized perspectives—formats that resemble the
media practices of established media institutions. Memes nonetheless
serve a *special* function in marginalized people’s intervention in
public political discourse. Unlike other media formats, memes are
typically characterized by a do-it-yourself-aesthetic. Basic editing,
bad photoshop jobs, visible copy and pasting, the regular occurrence of
what would elsewhere be considered spelling mistakes and references to
pop culture and entertainment media are all part of a basic and often
even purposefully trashy aesthetic. Memes are also humorous, which makes
them explicitly non-serious on yet another level. I thus argue that
memes, given these characteristics, must also be understood as a tool to
reject the whole logic of exclusive, elitist, top-down knowledge
production commonly performed by hegemonic, established media and
political institutions. I certainly see my own activist practice in such
a light, which is one of the reasons I take pride in actively trying to
use easily understandable language. The meme below, posted by
@kanaxanax[^14chapter12_17] on Instagram, serves as a poignant example of this kind
of criticism too. Using an image from an animated children’s movie—a
medium not typically taken too seriously—it questions the expertise and
legitimacy of those who are commonly given a platform in political talk
shows on German TV.

![Fig. 4: A meme by @kanaxanax on Instagram. It depicts a cartoon character turtle from the movie *Kung Fu Panda*, saying ‘My time has come’ while gazing into the distance. The added text reads: ‘German talk shows when they finally find an opportunity to discuss political and radical Islam with 5 white men and 1 German Islam scholar again.’](/Users/c.c.arkenbouthva.nl/Documents/GitHub/CriticalMemeReader/imgs/12.4.jpeg)

## Building Resilience Through Memes: When Life Sucks

Apart from being used to criticize and ridicule elitist knowledge
production, memes’ humor serves yet another purpose. In the case of
critical memes, humor is also an integral part of a collective
empowerment strategy used by marginalized people to build resilience
through a process of self-affirmation. Humor is deeply subjective.
Finding something funny, maybe even laughing about it, is therefore a
very intimate experience. Finding something funny *together* thus
creates a sense of collective intimacy and community. As Ashley Lorraine
Blewitt-Golsch argues in her study about transgender memes: in a context
of oppression, ‘\[t\]he relatability of the memes that ‘make it’ are the
foundation of group identity formation.’[^14chapter12_18] Through enabling this
collective experience and subsequent group identity, memes often play an
important role in strengthening marginalized people’s resilience.[^14chapter12_19]
As Blewitt-Golsch argues, ‘\[i\]t is a powerful feeling to know that one
is not alone in one’s discomfort.’[^14chapter12_20] Dealing with these violent
experiences *humorously* also offers moments of emotional relief. I made
the meme below after a press conference held by Austria’s Federal
Minister for Women and Integration. I experienced the press conference
and its media coverage as very emotionally draining, which is why I
decided to bring fun into it by ridiculing the minister’s anti-Muslim
rhetoric with a meme.

![Fig. 5: A meme I made and posted as @ibiza\_austrian\_memes on Instagram. The top depicts part of a newspaper article about Susanne Raab, Austrian Federal Minister for Women and Integration, who according to the screenshot warned against a ‘fertile ground for violence’ due to some people ‘only going to Turkish supermarkets and the mosque.’ Below is an image of pop culture figure Baby Yoda, a cute and innocent-looking baby alien. The alien is holding a Turkish pastry called Simit, that was edited into the original image. Baby Yoda is described as ‘My Simit and
I’. He says, ‘Hi Susi, I won’t hurt you if you don’t hurt me please thanks byyyeee’.](/Users/c.c.arkenbouthva.nl/Documents/GitHub/CriticalMemeReader/imgs/12.5.jpeg)

<br/>

After I had uploaded the meme I received a message from a Muslim
follower, who wrote, ‘Seriously, I opened your page three or four times
today and just kept thinking, please I need your content
😆❤️’. The ‘need’ for memes, that she is
articulating in her message, tells me that like me, she too was seeking
emotional relief in a humorous interpretation of the political rhetoric
we both experienced as violent. Hegemonic political and media discourse
treats discriminatory rhetoric and policies as entirely normal and
reasonable, which can cause intense feelings of helplessness and despair
in those—in *we*—who are affected by these forms of violence. From my
personal experience I know that humor can be tremendously helpful in
coping with this emotional distress. Memes like the one above let you
know that others also see the ridiculousness, the absurdity, and
violence of these politics. For people who are structurally
disadvantaged and discriminated against, memes can therefore induce a
strong feeling of togetherness by pointing out a shared perception of
reality. In such a context, memes can be a powerful way of affirming an
alternative reality and (co-)creating an alternative discourse—beyond
the one-dimensional, often harmful depictions and narratives pushed by
conventional media and public discourse.

As I described in the beginning, my own meme-making started as a
consequence of a political scandal and was fueled by an experience of
collective relief during its aftermath. As it turns out, however, we are
not only making memes when we experience relief—we are also gifting each
other experiences of relief when we are making memes.

[^14chapter12_2]: Werner Kogler from Green Party is currently Austrian vice
    chancellor. From its foundation in 1986 until 2017 the Green Party
    was always in parliament as a left opposition party. In the 2017
    elections, in which the abovementioned far-right government was
    elected, the Green Party lost two thirds of its votes and did not
    make it into parliament for the first time since its foundation.
    After the Ibiza-scandal and during the new election campaign, the
    Green Party framed itself as a left alternative, as climate
    protectors, and as an anti-corruption party. It was during this time
    that now vice chancellor Werner Kogler started following my page,
    which at the time mostly ridiculed the failed far-right coalition
    and its corruption scandals. In the new elections Sebastian Kurz
    (ÖVP), who was chancellor during the Ibiza-scandal, scored 37,5% of
    the votes, an even higher percentage than his party already had in
    2017. The Green Party celebrated a hugely successful comeback with
    13,9% of the votes, its best election result ever, and became a
    governing party for the first time in its history. Today we still
    have a coalition between the far right ÖVP and a weak Green Party.
    Key leftist issues, such as women’s rights, migration and
    integration, or labor lie in the ÖVP’s hands, leaving many Green
    voters disappointed and discontent. Chancellor Sebastian Kurz
    introduced the historically new coalition by announcing that it was
    going to unite ‘the best of both worlds’ by ‘protecting the climate
    *and* the borders’, which I think says it all.
