# **Mimetic Sameness**

###Grant Bollmer

## A New Replicator, A New Exterior to Rationality

The concept of the meme came into being with a chapter near the end of
Richard Dawkins’ book *The Selfish Gene*. While these ‘origins’ are
common knowledge, the *reasons* Dawkins gives for describing memes, in a
book otherwise about evolution and genetics, are not so widely
acknowledged. Dawkins lamented that he knew of no explanation of human
behavior acceptable to his particular Darwinian sensibilities. Hence the
need for a ‘new replicator’, the meme, a ‘thing’ analogous to a gene
which obeys many of the same genetic principles Dawkins sketches
elsewhere. The meme is ‘a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of
*imitation*’,[^15chapter14_1] one that follows a rationalistic logic of evolution. The meme is
that which gives us ‘culture’: culture as an accumulation of discrete,
competing practices, trends, and statements—‘tunes, ideas,
catch-phrases, clothes fashions, ways of making pots or of building
arches’[^15chapter14_2]—which swirl around and evolve according to Darwinian
reasoning.

If evolution is true, then culture, Dawkins assumes, must likewise
follow the same biological principles. But this is begging the question.
Why did Dawkins think we need an evolutionary understanding of
‘culture’, anyway? It’s obvious Dawkins has never paid attention to
cultural anthropology, cultural studies, anything that has worked to
theorize or understand what ‘culture’ might even be.[^15chapter14_3] His reasoning
becomes a bit clearer if we note that his examples of memes are
*religious*. While he begins with what I reference above—ideas,
fashions, artistic techniques—what Dawkins focuses most on are the
belief in god, religious laws, faith, and celibacy. Given his notorious
atheism, the point of a meme seems mostly about explaining why ideas and
behavior Dawkins believes *irrational*—those at odds with beliefs and
acts that confer some biological, competitive advantage—persist.[^15chapter14_4]
Dawkins even ends his chapter with a call to reject the mimetic nature
of culture: ‘We, alone on earth, can revel against the tyranny of the
selfish replicators’.[^15chapter14_5] Rather than an extension of an evolutionary
logic to describe culture alone, the initial proposal of the meme is a
call to reject religion, and further to reject any nonscientific
cultural formation reliant on repetition rather than rationality.
Dawkins does not seem to place ‘science’ in any space occupied by
‘culture’. Scientific reasoning is not subject to mimetic repetition, is
not linked with ‘ideas’ that merely repeat. That which is not scientific
continues to exist because of repetition rather than rationality.
Consequently, *the meme is the irrational*. It impedes the revelation of
the true that is empirical, positivistic thought.

Why should we assume culture to be based on a mindless, irrational
replication and imitation, a definition that would make ‘science’, which
is not based in this mindless repetition, something divorced from
‘culture’? This supposes not only an analogy between culture and
genetics, but also an equivalence between humans and machines that
reduces the capacities of community, sociality, and the body to little
more than the generation and maintenance of flows (of information, of
capital, of biological matter).[^15chapter14_6] Reproduction—both sexual and
informational—becomes an act to perpetuate both selfish genes and
irrational ideas. Even if we do not accept Dawkins’ definition of the
meme as ‘genetic’, any argument about memes remains haunted by his
implicit binary opposition between ‘rational’ science and ‘irrational’
culture, between ‘reason’ and ‘unreason’, between ‘invention’ and
‘imitation’.

Culture, when reduced to repetition, becomes something to be dismissed
as a barrier to knowledge. This binary does not originate with Dawkins
and can be traced back to Platonic and Aristotelian debates about
*mimesis* and art, at least. But it probably achieves its most modern
formulation (in ways that directly precede Dawkins and, for that matter,
most theories of communication) in the work of the *fin de siècle*
French sociologist Gabriel Tarde. I think Tarde provides one of the
better understandings of cultural repetition but, as I’ll return to at
the end of this chapter, he assumes similar things to Dawkins about
rationality and repetition. The point of this chapter is to highlight
how discussions of memes and mimesis regularly presume rationality to be
opposed to cultural automatism: an opposition between *poiesis* and
*mimesis*, a repetition and mirroring that remains both “illegitimate”
but also necessary for cultural and social relation. The lesson of memes
Dawkins seems to want to teach is as follows: culture is stupid; it
exists to prevent science from achieving its place as rational master.

Memes, in other words, are a negative form proposed as an exterior to
the truth of rationality. Rationality finds its coherence by positing a
‘thing’ essential for the perpetuation of the irrationality of culture,
the mindlessness of the crowd, and fascism of the group; a ‘thing’ to be
resisted and excluded for evolutionary rationalism to claim authority; a
‘thing’ invented as the barrier to rationalism’s own self-realization.
Until a radically different theory of memes is proposed—one that not
only differs from Dawkins’ but actively repudiates the meme as a name
for the persistence of public, unthinking irrationality undermining the
logic of positivistic truth—then we remain in a space that assumes memes
to be little more than a mode of mindless repetition, accepting
positivism as the only alternative to the unthinking mass that is
‘culture’.

Let’s consider a specific work that engages directly with these themes:
the livestreamed play *Circle Jerk*, which was written by Michael
Breslin and Patrick Foley and performed by their theater company, Fake
Friends, in late 2020.[^15chapter14_7] *Circle Jerk*, a satire of both contemporary
digital culture as well as (white) gay male sexuality, links the
mindless, irrational repetitiveness of the meme to emergent fears of
fascistic disinformation spread over social media. It does so through
the creation of a ‘meme machine’, a technology that generates a
fascistic sameness through unthinking imitation. With the meme machine,
*Circle Jerk* provides a way of thinking about the (in)commensurability
of rationality, repetition, and sameness, especially as articulated by
social media and streaming video on platforms such as TikTok. In
addition, *Circle Jerk* engages with how these themes of repetition and
sameness were addressed in 1990’s queer theory, updating them for a
conjuncture defined by social media. I want to elaborate how the link
between memes and mindless repetition of the same is tacitly assumed in
how we understand and imagine the politics of social media. But, at the
same time, this assumption provokes questions about relation and
reproduction. These questions have different implications when
‘evolutionary’ arguments about reproduction are positioned against a
critique of a (heteronormative) injunction to reproduce (in this case,
reproductions both sexual and ideal, relating to Dawkins’ understanding
of both genetics and mimetics). The alternative to Dawkins’ fear of
mimesis is to revel in the failure of repetition, the failure of
communication, the generation of memes that cannot be but nonmimetic.

## The Meme Machine

*\
Circle Jerk* is one of the most successful examples of the many
livestreamed digital theatre productions of 2020, when the dangers of
coronavirus contagion required a reinvention of theatrical liveness for
online, distanced streaming. Most examples of theatre from this time can
be summed up with the phrase ‘Zoom Play’. This includes plays that used
videostreaming platforms nondiegetically, with actors speaking lines in
individualized boxes on a screen (so, the audience is viewing a
performance as if they’re viewing yet another example of the Zoom
meetings that many of us are were dealing with every day). ’Zoom Play’
also includes a number of examples which used technology in a diegetic
fashion, such as Richard Nelson’s *What Do We Need to Talk About*
(2020), which was both performed over Zoom and had a plot that took
place over Zoom, or Doug Liman’s terrible film *Locked Down* (2021),
which used communication over Zoom and Skype as major parts of the plot.

*Circle Jerk*, instead of following this ‘Zoom Play’ style, incorporated
an inventive staging setup with twelve programmable cameras and a video
design that appropriated memes from TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube. It
also created its own variants of notable genres of videos from these
platforms, such as those of the mukbang and ASMR varieties.[^15chapter14_8] *Circle
Jerk* was livestreamed, though not over a videoconferencing platform,
and used its setup to comment directly on the model of sociality
implicit in social media video—sequences of the play involved facetuning
different characters’ appearances, and the play incorporated characters
mimetically copying popular dances from TikTok. *Circle Jerk* used the
possibility of a livestreamed play to directly reproduce and comment on
various internet practices associated with social media platforms that
use livestreamed video.

Taking its name from both the ‘homoerotic ritual’ and the subreddit
‘/r/circlejerk’,[^15chapter14_9] the play begins with the cancelling and
deplatforming of Jurgen Yionoullis, a not-exactly-subtle riff on Milo
Yiannopoulos. Jurgen is a ‘gay self help guru’ who has secretly funneled
his ‘millennial fans’ into an ‘alt-right artificial intelligence
propaganda scam’. But his plans are halted as his ‘meme machine’, an
‘artificially intelligent database of the world’s socio-political,
sexual-libidinal perversions’, has become ‘indecently exposed’. While
initially Jurgen’s goal was simply to gain fame and money, after his
cancellation he reframes the meme machine as a method of enacting
*sameness*, a sameness that would undo his cancellation and enable him
to feel ‘safe’ by making everyone like him. Memes, at the beginning of
*Circle Jerk*, are a machinic form of repetition that not only act as
propaganda, entrancing Jurgen’s ostensibly liberal-leaning fans towards
alt-right causes, but also can be harnessed to create a world of
uniformity, in which everyone becomes, as Jurgen claims, ‘a mirror me, a
me-me’. We can see, then, both a perpetuation of Dawkins’ understanding
of memes—as an irrational replication that generates groupthink—and a
connection of this replication and sameness to a narcissistic desire to
make the rest of the world equivalent to oneself.

Memes—both as a means of repetition and a means to create mirrorings of
oneself—thus serve to chart what we might frame as an opposition between
homophily and heterophily, terms which, in their use today, articulate
both social networks and sexuality. Homophily, as Wendy Hui Kyong Chun
has noted, is the belief that social relations are formed out of
similarity, an argument essential for mathematical models of network
science. ‘If we are inside-out, it is because homophily, love as love of
the same, closes the world it pretends to open; it makes cyberspace a
series of echo chambers’.[^15chapter14_10] Network science begins and ends with a
necessary and intractable attraction of the same. Like attracts like,
and it does so everywhere when we extend social networks beyond social
media. The very foundation of social existence, if we presume networks
and connection, is homophilic. Society is made up of links of sameness,
presuming sameness, repeating the same information, transmitting the
same thing, over and over and over again.[^15chapter14_11] If memes assume
replication, replication, replication (leading—for Dawkins at
least—towards a mass mind of bad, religious ideas), *Circle Jerk* links
these concerns of sameness and difference (homophily and heterophily,
homosociality and heterosociality) to concerns long held for a radical
queer politics.

## The Same and the Other

As Leo Bersani (whose famous essay ‘Is the Rectum a Grave?’[^15chapter14_12] is
directly referenced in *Circle Jerk*) put it in 1995:

> Although there are valid grounds for questioning the assumption that
> desire between men, or between women, is desire for ‘the same’, it is
> also true that because our apprenticeship in desiring takes place
> within that assumption, homosexuality can become a privileged model of
> sameness—one that makes manifest not the limits but the inestimable
> value of relations of sameness, of homo-relations. Perhaps inherent in
> gay desire is a revolutionary inaptitude for heteroized sociality.
> This of course means sociality as we know it…[^15chapter14_13]

Sociality ‘as we know it’ is, in Bersani’s argument, about sexual
difference and an attraction to the other. This idea has been further
extended by Lee Edelman, and also resonates with arguments from
materialist feminists who see the reproduction of society (of capital,
of labor) as built on sexual reproduction and thus, heterosexual desire
and procreation.[^15chapter14_14] And while it may point towards a weird historical
irony (that social media has completely rewritten assumed social
heterophily to a technically enforced homophily), Bersani’s
understanding of ‘the same’ here isn’t something so crude as a fascism
of mimetics, but rather has much in common with Monique Wittig’s attacks
on gender differentiation.[^15chapter14_15] But, what I’m suggesting is that social
media and the internet have rewritten desire in a way that normalizes a
form of attraction that once was understood as an oppositional form
against compulsory heterosexuality. Heterophily is sociality
fundamentally underwritten by desire for the other, for difference—a
desire which is today bizarrely alien to the models presumed by social
networks.[^15chapter14_16]

Of course, things are not quite that simple. Social media has seemingly
concretized and stabilized identity so one can be known and predicted as
a target market,[^15chapter14_17] which, in its presumption of an identity that
remains the same over time, is a different sameness than the sameness
Bersani advocates. Additionally, Bersani’s sameness is not equivalence;
it is instead a space in which differentiation cannot be successfully
completed. His sameness is an attempt to remove capacities of
differentiation that serve to reproduce homophobia, misogyny,
patriarchy, and so on. It points towards a removal of (binary)
difference, which would permit a more radical form of (multiple,
undefined) difference to flourish. True sameness inevitably
fails—repetition is always an ‘inaccurate self-replication’.[^15chapter14_18]
Equivalence of the copy is always flawed.

This desire for the same nonetheless speaks to the desire expressed in
*Circle Jerk*—a desire for me-mes produced through memes. And *Circle
Jerk* points to how this political suggestion of Bersani’s—in an age of
an internet that *presumes* homophily, that begins from the assumption
that *all* attraction, and not just queer attraction, is attraction to
the same—has been rendered unworkable. And yet, this reversal does not
mean that *difference* is a way to resist the hegemony of the internet’s
homophily, a difference that would ‘heteroize’ the sameness assumed by
networked mimesis. Rather, a sense of sameness that was implicit in
Bersani’s work has become subsumed by the digital, and the solution to
this subsumption may be to further embrace Bersani’s arguments—to follow
sameness through to its eventual failure, degradation, and
collapse.[^15chapter14_19]

Jurgen (with his conspirator, Lord Bussy) eventually upgrades his meme
machine post-cancellation, reinventing it as a vague, indistinct,
artificially intelligent avatar which appears to mirror left-wing causes
and interests. This persona is designed to disseminate a message that
presumes complete sameness, a sameness that sounds like belonging and
identification but also carries with it the fascism that emerges from
these desires. The new meme machine Jurgen and Bussy invent is a point
of erotic identification with oneself, an influencer ‘meme’ and
‘contagion queen’, named Eva María, who is ‘Black but not-Black’ and
‘infinitely diverse’, with a voice module taken from an ‘Alexia’ voice
assistant (*alexia* being both a nod to Amazon’s voice assistant and a
disorder where one who was once able to read loses the ability to do
so). Jurgen and Bussy program Eva María to appeal to ‘every libtard in
New York City’ through a ‘heterogenous’ method of micro-targeting
individuals to generate a homogenous, white-supremacist sameness.

Drawing on the language of Emmanuel Levinas, Byung-Chul Han has argued
that the internet and social media are machines for producing the
endless repetition of the *same*. This is how we should understand Eva
María: as a machine that appears as different, as other, only in order
to perpetuate the same, over and over. In the work of Levinas, the
‘same’ (or, in French, *le même*) is self-identity, the ‘I’, which
Levinas opposes with the ‘other’, or the metaphysical infinitude hidden
behind the face of another.[^15chapter14_20] For Levinas, the essence of ethics is
the refusal to reduce the other to the same, to admit the infinite
openness of otherness that cannot and should not be reduced to one’s
‘I’, to one’s ‘sameness’. Han equates these terms to ‘positivity’ and
‘negativity’, suggesting that the negativity of the other has been
completely eliminated with contemporary technology. The same is the
positive, the visible, the smooth and narcissistic surface inherent in
the digital, the other is the negative, a metaphysical irruption of
nonknowledge and uncertainty:

> Seamless *liking* produces a realm of positivity. Experience as
> irruption of the *other*—because of its negativity—interrupts
> imaginary self-mirroring. But the positivity that is inherent in
> digital technology minimizes the possibility of having any such
> experience. It prolongs only the *same*.[^15chapter14_21]

What we see in *Circle Jerk* is how the sameness of what Bersani calls
‘homo-ness’, which does not do away with difference *as such* but
embraces difference *without category*, is subsumed into the homophily
of hyper-specific target marketing, not allowing a sameness of category
and permitting only a sameness of *individuality*. What we see in
*Circle Jerk* is, instead of Bersani’s sameness, the reduction of the
world to Han’s *same*, in which I substitute myself for all others, a
fascism of me-mes rather than a diversity without category.[^15chapter14_22] What
*Circle Jerk* presents is, in many ways, the end result of Dawkins’
opposition between rationality and irrationality—the replication of
memes permits the generation of an unthinking, fascistic mass.

## Mimetic Individuality

This sameness of individuality is best illustrated in *Circle Jerk* when
Eva María generates a number of (ostensibly) infinite video variants,
all of which carry with them the same message about the desirability of
sameness. Each video is crafted for a particular person/target, and they
take the form of, among other things, conspiracies about the suppression
of a transgender American history, global warming and children, and an
ASMR video designed for a ‘curator’ with no professional credits. In
this last video, Eva María says (conflating ‘socially constructed’ with
‘fake’), ‘We are not damaged. Damage and trauma are social
constructions… Imagine being in a world in which we are the majority.
Not just a majority, the vast majority. Ninety percent of the people. A
place where we are not the minority. A place where people understand who
you are, naturally—you don’t have to explain yourself’. The play then
incorporates images of celebrities (including drag queens from *RuPaul’s
Drag Race* and Mike Pence), all now with faces morphed into or combined
with Eva María’s face. We eventually see a video of a man walking on a
beach (also with Eva María’s face), repeating her ASMR monologue.
Sameness has taken hold, one in which everyone thinks they have their
own ideas but are merely repeating the videos made for them by the meme
machine. *Circle Jerk* effectively inverts Bersani—it begins with
individuality to generate a sameness that never fails, but only repeats
ad nauseum.

Mimetic similitude as a foundation for social relations is perhaps best
elaborated in the work of Gabriel Tarde. Around 1900, Tarde elaborated a
foundational ‘law’ for all social relations—for a universal
sociology—relations are always ‘*individual initiative followed by
imitation*’.[^15chapter14_23] Ideas and trends emerge from particular ‘geniuses’ or
‘elites’ who are then copied by followers.[^15chapter14_24] This is directly what we
see in *Circle Jerk*—Jurgen, who notes how he belongs to the ‘1%’, uses
the ‘genius’ of his meme machine to generate a universal, fascist
repetition to make the rest of the world equivalent to himself. This
‘genius’ is a problem for our present understanding of memes and
mimesis. Tony Sampson has reinvented Tarde’s sociology as a ‘dystopian
media theory’ to describe how masses of people are subsumed into a
‘collective nonconscious, caught in the shockwaves of the event’.[^15chapter14_25]
Sampson explicitly denies the source of imitation in a ‘genius’
individual,[^15chapter14_26] but the presence or absence of a genetic origin—or the
ability to locate this origin—does not really matter. In *Circle Jerk*,
the trick of the meme is to induce sameness at an individual level, with
each person believing themselves to be the origin of the meme through
which they become united as a fascist mass.

## The Uncanny and the Dream-Meme 

The eeriness of the double is essential for any Freudian notion of the
uncanny. The doppelgänger is a failed copy, a duplicate that is partial,
limited, and thus strange. But after social media, data analytics, and
digital doubles, Kriss Ravetto-Biagioli has suggested that the ‘digital
uncanny’ be thought not in terms of doubling or even failure. Rather, it
is the fear that ‘we are machines and that our behavior may be
predictable precisely because we are machinic’.[^15chapter14_27] The digital uncanny
emerges because the double is more me than myself, more known than
myself, more powerful than myself. *Circle Jerk*, at multiple times,
references the song ‘Who R U’ by JUFU, a song popularized because of its
repetitive use on TikTok. JUFU’s video for this song[^15chapter14_28] takes a
typical representation of the Freudian uncanny as its theme, with JUFU
encountering a copy of himself. ‘Who are you?’ JUFU asks his
doppelgänger. ‘I am you!’ it replies. ‘I am me.’ ‘No sir, you are you.’
Typical TikTok videos using this song play with the doubling of someone,
the impossibility to distinguish between self and other, the reduction
of other to the same. Instead of a feeling of uncanniness, an amusement
at the repetition of mimetic copying. Rather than becoming creeped out
at our failed copies, *we* are the copies to begin with.[^15chapter14_29]

Memes—if we understand memes to be a simple form of repetitive
transmission—are a means for producing the same. What would it mean for
memes to fail at repetition? To effectively cease to be memes? The
uncanny is one way to embrace the failure of the same, a disquiet that
emerges from the inability of identity to maintain itself. The final act
of *Circle Jerk* embraces this failure in another way. The seemingly
unified sameness produced by the meme machine begins to collapse as the
relation between different characters, their limited self-identities,
the memes they repeat, are all mixed together in a cacophony that openly
appropriates from TikTok and reduces the possibility of a mimetic
similarity to rubble.

Both the Freudian uncanny and *Circle Jerk*’s chaos are particular ways
the same fails to remain the same. Alongside these, I want to end by
gesturing towards a radically different kind of meme, those of ‘Thomas
the Plank Engine’,[^15chapter14_30] a subreddit devoted to representing memes people
see in their dreams. The ‘meme’ that gives this subreddit its name was
one posted to another subreddit, r/me\_irl. It was captioned, ‘i saw
this meme in a dream and remade it as best as i could’. This dream meme
is made up of twelve faces of Thomas the Tank Engine and a wooden plank.
While most of Thomas’s faces are happy and smiling, one is ambivalent
and one is angry.[^15chapter14_31] The nonsensical nature of r/thomastheplankengine
can be seen in its countless dream memes, which—to provide a random but
representative selection—include ‘an image of a microfibre mop’ with the
captions (in Impact Bold, of course) ‘ACTIVE DRY YEAST’ and ‘YOU’RE
3rd’.[^15chapter14_32] Another example is described as the result of a dream in
which a redditor ‘was hitting a tennis ball with a ruler’. This dream
meme depicts, on the left side of the image, a silhouette of a cricketer
swinging a ruler. On the right side, there’s a black and white gradient
with a tennis ball poorly photoshopped in the middle. At the top of the
gradient is a circled number 1 next to ‘TOP TEXT’, a circled number 2 is
in the middle, and at the bottom, ‘BOTTOM TEXT’.[^15chapter14_33] With these weird
condensations and displacements, mimetic repetition fails when mediated
by the unconscious. These examples *try* to be memes. They draw on
formal elements that seem ‘meme-like’. And yet, in mediating dreams
these memes become unrepeatable. The memes of Thomas the Plank Engine do
not produce copies—they are memes that halt and stupefy the ability of a
meme to become me-mes.

Instead of repetition, instead of sameness, we have misrecognition and
self-alienation, perpetual failures in the compulsion to repeat: a
mimetics that can only remain other even if it seems guided by a desire
for the same.

    University Press, 2006), 192.

[^15chapter14_2]: Dawkins, *Selfish Gene*, 192.

[^15chapter14_3]: At the beginning of the chapter, Dawkins reports that he uses the
    word culture ‘not in its snobbish sense, but as a scientist uses it’
    (Dawkins, *Selfish Gene*, 189). This suggests that he has no
    familiarity with any of the debates about culture that have occurred
    since Raymond Williams, at least, wrote *Culture and Society:
    1780-1950* (New York: Columbia University Press, 1958).

[^15chapter14_4]: This is most explicit with ideas about celibacy and monogamy, so
    often linked with religion as they are. Any belief that restricts
    sexual reproduction, for instance, is difficult for an evolutionary
    psychological perspective to explain.

[^15chapter14_5]: Dawkins, *Selfish Gene*, 201.

[^15chapter14_6]: An equivalence between communication, biology, and technology (and
    finance) is central for the convoluted history of the idea of
    ‘networked connectivity’. See the first part of my book, *Inhuman
    Networks: Social Media and the Archaeology of Connection* (New York:
    Bloomsbury, 2016).

[^15chapter14_9]: I’m using the language the website of the play uses to describe
    itself (Fake Friends, ‘*Circle Jerk*: About’,
    <a href="https://circlejerk.live/about">https://circlejerk.live/about</a>). On Reddit, a ‘circlejerk’ refers to
    a form of self-congratulatory groupthink, and the subreddit
    r/circlejerk is used to call these moments out. At the same time, as
    one Reddit user has put it, r/circlejerk is an ‘anti-circlejerk
    circlejerk where circlejerk-aware redditors pat one another on the
    back for being smarter than the average circlejerking redditor’
    (apopheniac1989, Reddit comment, 3 November 2013,

[^15chapter14_10]: Wendy Hui Kyong Chun, “Queering Homophily,” in Clemens Apprich,
    et al., *Pattern Discrimination* (Lüneburg: meson press, 2018), 60.

[^15chapter14_11]: Which is particularly evident in studies of ‘social contagion’,
    which have been the most powerful example of how network models—at
    the height of the popularity of network science—moved beyond the
    internet to describe anything ‘social’. I’ve discussed this in
    *Inhuman Networks*, and Chun has discussed this in *Updating to
    Remain the Same: Habitual New Media* (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press,
    2016).

[^15chapter14_12]: Leo Bersani, *Is the Rectum a Grave?: And Other Essays* (Chicago:
    University of Chicago Press, 2010).

    Dialectic of Sex: The Case for Feminist Revolution* (New York:
    Bantam, 1970); Endnotes Collective, ‘The Logic of Gender’,

[^15chapter14_15]: Bersani, *Homos*, 41-47. Cf. Monique Wittig, *The Straight Mind
    and Other Essays* (Boston: Beacon Press, 1992); Katherine Guinness,
    *Schizogenesis: The Art of Rosemarie Trockel* (Minneapolis:
    University of Minnesota Press, 2019), 29-33.

[^15chapter14_16]: Contrast Chun’s “Queering Homophily” with Bersani’s arguments.

[^15chapter14_17]: See Grant Bollmer, *Theorizing Digital Cultures* (London: SAGE,
    2018), 121-134.

[^15chapter14_18]: This is a regular theme of the essays collected in Bersani, *Is
    the Rectum a Grave?*

[^15chapter14_19]: The opposition of sameness to digitality, I think, is also what
    guides Alexander Galloway’s *Laruelle: Against the Digital*
    (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2014).

[^15chapter14_22]: This is a theme Katherine Guinness has been developing in her
    articles “The Coloniser and Corpus Nullius,” *parallax* 26, no. 1
    (2020): 76-88, and “Self-Portraiture and Self-Performance,” in
    *Visual Culture Approaches to the Selfie*, ed. Derek Conrad Murray
    (New York: Routledge, forthcoming), and it also has significant
    parallels with how Guinness defines ‘the neutral’ in
    *Schizogenesis*.

[^15chapter14_25]: Tony D. Sampson, *A Sleepwalker’s Guide to Social Media*
    (Cambridge: Polity, 2020), 16.

[^15chapter14_26]: Interestingly, Sampson suggests the foregrounding of an
    individual as a “source” turns Tarde into Dawkins. Sampson,
