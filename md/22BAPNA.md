# **Post-Truth Design Tactics in Memes in India: Decoding Malicious Design Practices in Right-Wing Meme Factories**

###By Aarushi Bapna and Ajitesh Lokhande

On May 12, 2017, two people suspected to be child kidnappers were
lynched in the Indian village of Jadugora, in the eastern state of
Jharkhand. The panic and fear that eventually led to this lynching can
be traced back to a series of WhatsApp forwards that were being widely
circulated in the state. These messages included pictures showing dead
children and warned about so-called ‘child lifters’. The May 12 lynching
was one of several that were about to follow all across the country.
This incident was one of the first major stories covered by Indian media
about the real-life consequences of viral online content.[^19chapter18_1]

When the Oxford Dictionary chose ‘post-truth’ as its word of the year in
2016, the waves of global post-truth politics had just begun to ripple
out. Now in 2021, we have been hit by multiple tsunamis of events whose
triggers can be traced back to post-truth politics: the insurrection at
the United States Capitol weeks before the inauguration of the new
president; anti-mask demonstrations worldwide;[^19chapter18_2] conspiracy theories
regarding COVID-19 being a hoax; and the Indian government’s nation-wide
social media campaign targeting one specific celebrity (Rihanna).[^19chapter18_3]

But while post-truth politics is a complex and layered concept from a
socio-political perspective, it might be helpful to narrow our cone of
vision and try to look at it from a visual design lens. One of the
easiest ways to look at its impact on our daily lives might be to look
in memes. Much has been written about memes from a cultural, ideological
and quantitative perspective,[^19chapter18_4] but visual design analysis seems
sparse.

India’s rich visual vocabulary of signs and symbols, emerging from its
culture and history, have found their way into memes. Being avid meme
enthusiasts and having been trained as visual designers in India, we
went down the algorithmic rabbit hole of Hindu Right-Wing memes and
conducted a qualitative analysis, to highlight visual design techniques
used in their propagation.

## Indian Political Scenario 

### Ruling Party Powered Meme Factories

In India the Overton Window has long shifted, transforming the former
*political right* into the *center.* [^19chapter18_5] Recent polarizing events like
the CAA-NRC and the farm-bill protests have contributed to this shift in
perception. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is the current ruling
political party heading the Indian government. This party has become
infamous for its information technology wing known as the *IT Cell*.
They have a vast network of paid workers and volunteers who manage the
party’s online presence and digital outreach. This management has often
included the creation of bot accounts and starting Twitter trends, among
other questionable practices like spreading fake-news and
performingsocial engineering.[^19chapter18_6] They reportedly mobilized 50,000
WhatsApp groups to reach about 200,000,000 voters in a single state
election.

During one political rally by the ruling party, one of the leaders
ofBJP’s IT Cell (a sitting cabinet minister) boasted of their capacity
to deliver any ‘any message we want to the public, whether sweet or
sour, true of \[sic\] fake.[^19chapter18_7] The political establishment is not only
aware of this culture of fact-denying, disinformation, and post-truth
politics, but occasionally it even takes part in it.

To fully understand
the context of fake-news in India, one needs to understand a phenomenon
that is a more evolved form of sensationalism. This phenomenon is
planned, designed to grab attention, appeal to emotion, and set trends
for political discourse. This is where the *Aestheticization of
Politics* comes in.

## Memes as Aestheticization of Politics

In his essay *The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction*,
Walter Benjamin mentions the ‘Aestheticization of Politics’. This is
when effective democratic governance is sidetracked and focus is shifted
to sweeping, grand political gestures [^19chapter18_8]. The result is an emotionally
appealing, ‘aesthetic’ narrative that often hides objectively cruel
violence behind it, or even glorifies it. Looking to India, we can
findan example of aestheticized political acts in Modi’s reframed
narrative of reuniting the abandoned state of Kashmir with the rest of
India. Contrary to this narrative, in fact the state was annexed by
overriding constitutional parliamentary procedures. This nation-unifying
narrative seems to contain a ‘*kernel of truth*’, but one distorted and
buried beneath its political aestheticization.[^19chapter18_9]

In this example, the actions are such that they sound appealing in
theory and in their storytelling. But this grand storytelling hides the
actual inefficiency and authoritarian nature of the actions themselves.
Walter Benjamin describes the ‘aestheticization of politics’ generally
as enacted by politicians and artists (e.g. Futurist Art that glorifies
war and violence as beneficial to human development).[^19chapter18_10] The medium of
the meme makes this practice of aestheticizing politics and violence
accessible to any person with an internet connection.

### Types of ‘Aestheticization of Politics’

![Fig. 1: Types of Aestheticization of Politics](/Users/c.c.arkenbouthva.nl/Documents/GitHub/CriticalMemeReader/imgs/18.1.jpeg)

<br/>

Today, the paradigm shift to be considered is the emergence of memes as
an extremely accessible tool of aestheticizing politics (e.g. Hello
Kitty says ‘ACAB’,[^19chapter18_11] Lindsay Graham DGAF memes,[^19chapter18_12] Apply Burnol
memes celebrating right-wing political achievements [^19chapter18_13]).

## Decoding Memes 

The nature of propaganda is overtly visible in traditional
media—advertising, political murals, speeches, etc. However, it is more
covert on social media in the form of memes. The Indian right-wing seems
to borrow heavily from various propaganda techniques that have been used
by many fascist governments as well as corporate companies, These vary
from the *ad nauseam* rhetoric of a Hindu Rashtra*,*[^19chapter18_14] flag-waving of
saffron Hindutva symbols, or the constant use of logical and informal
fallacies. These tactics naturally find their way into online
communication. Various actors co-opt visual design to extend these
tactics to apparently harmless memes. Lisa Bogerts and Maik Fielitz
argue that, as political tools, ‘memes combine a variety of stylistic
and aesthetic strategies and visual tools to appeal to multiple
audiences, and still convey messages in line with their core ideological
far-right beliefs’.[^19chapter18_15] In the same study, they also state that ‘Since
the far-right, too, has undergone a process of (post-)modernization, it
must be regarded as closely intertwined with post-modern (youth)
cultures who express themselves creatively and often ironically on
social media.’ Virality defeats veracity, and one of the key ingredients
of this fact-defying virality is its visuality. 

### Meme 1: One Nation, One Flag

![Fig. 2: One Nation One Flag. Source: @saffronpilled, One Nation One Flag, 2019, Instagram Post, <https://www.instagram.com/p/BzA4B9cFs7W/>](/Users/c.c.arkenbouthva.nl/Documents/GitHub/CriticalMemeReader/imgs/18.2.jpeg)

<br/>

In the meme in figure 2, we see a combination of visual symbols. The
lighting, the retrofuturist car, and the CGI 3D environment are key
ingredients from the Synthwave aesthetic. The uncanny additions are the
*saffron flags* (official symbol of RSS[^19chapter18_16]), a saffron map of South
and South-East Asia, and the slogan ‘One Nation, One Flag’. These are
recurring symbols of the right-wing Hindu nationalist ideology. The use
of the propaganda technique of repetition is apparent here.

This meme associates urban development and Hindu nationalism. The
imagery used for this is highly western with skyscrapers, neon lights
etc. However, the message is anti-western: that of an imperialist Hindu
Nation, thus, creating a certain amount of cognitive dissonance. The
idea of a Hindu nationalist empire is made more attractive to a viewer
by co-opting Synthwave aesthetics. Bogerts and Fielitz make a very
similar observation in the context of the German alt-right: ‘These
trendy visuals make historical references less “old-fashioned” and more
appealing to a younger audience and/or persons with an affinity to 80s
popular culture’.[^19chapter18_17]

Another tactic, the use of *virtuous imagery*, the rising sun in this
case, is also employed. The meme visually equates the idea of the Hindu
empire to a rising sun on the horizon. By using these techniques this
meme efficiently presents the idea of a Hindu Nation to a young audience
immersed in digital culture.

### Meme 2: Hindu Lives Matter

![Fig. 3: Hindu Lives Matter Source: @bharatincrisis, Hindu Lives Matter meme, 2020, Instagram Post, <https://www.instagram.com/p/CLMMSfdABK6/?igshid=1kf3pts4eyki3>](/Users/c.c.arkenbouthva.nl/Documents/GitHub/CriticalMemeReader/imgs/18.3.jpeg)

<br/>

In figure 3, we see yet another visual aesthetic being exploited. The
visual style mimics an activist, outraged, and intellectual stance. It
dissociates *Hindutva* ideology from its widely held perception of being
orthodox, violent, and non-intellectual. Thus, in this imitation, we see
this post exploiting the propaganda technique of trendification, whereby
a trending visual style is appropriated for propaganda purposes.

The tall condensed typography with its spray-paint treatment, in black
and yellow colors, are highly reminiscent of the graphics and visual
language that emerged around the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020.
Through imitation and transfer*,* it seeks to elicit a similar reaction
of indignation from the viewer by creating a twisted and false
equivalence between the systemic atrocities faced by Black people in the
US, with supposed atrocities faced by majority Hindus in India. Further,
the processed image of Martin Luther King Jr. and the lyrics of ‘We
Shall Overcome’ hint at this false narrative of Hindu-victimization.

This particular post was released in response to the murder of Rinku
Sharma.[^19chapter18_18] It reframes ‘Not all Muslims are guilty’ as nothing but the
Indian equivalent of ‘All Lives Matter’, ignoring the systemic
vilification of minority Muslims. Thus, we see this post relying on a
completely false equivalence to support its position.

### Meme 3: Sanskari (Virtuous) Girl meme

![Fig. 4: Girl wearing Sari
Source: @hindutvamemes, Girl Wearing Sari, 2021, Instagram Post, <https://www.instagram.com/p/CNt4ug6Lxd4>](/Users/c.c.arkenbouthva.nl/Documents/GitHub/CriticalMemeReader/imgs/18.4.jpeg)

<br/>

Figure 4, is much less political in comparison to figures 2 and 3. It uses the well-known meme template of ‘Godzilla vs. Kong vs. Doge’. In
this two-panel object labeling meme, we see Godzilla and Kong being
equated to ‘girl wearing jeans-top’ and ‘girl wearing burkha’
respectively. It is helpful to know that in the Indian context, ‘girl
wearing jeans-top’ is symbolic of modernism *and* Westernization.
Similarly, ‘girl wearing burkha’ is a crude stereotype of the Muslim
faith. ‘Girl wearing sari’ however, in a reductive symmetry, is symbolic
of virtuosity.

As the Godzilla vs. Kong vs. Doge meme template is usually seen using
the Arial, or Impact fonts, we can speculate that the choice of Comic
Sans intends to enhance the humorousness of the meme.

By associating the positive, much-loved character of Doge with the
symbol of ‘Girl wearing Sari’ (traditional attire) the meme seeks to
play up Hindu cultural supremacy. We can also deduct that this remix
employs the Virtuous Imagery tactic. The idea of fundamentalist Hindutva
attacking western and Muslim culture is made more acceptable by
associating it with a lovable character like Doge.

### The Resulting Tactics

As part of writing this article, we applied visual deconstruction and
qualitative analysis to 60 memes. By comparing our analyses with
documented propaganda techniques, we found the following tactics to have
emerged in a visual form through memes.

### Trendification 

Adapting historical and political contexts to trendy visual genres or
subcultures to appeal to their respective audiences. These trends may
include aesthetic styles, current events & pop culture references.

![Fig. 5: ‘Govt’s involvement in protecting Hindu temple and civilization’ Fig. 5 is a reference to a ship getting stuck at the Suez Canal in March
‘21 and was a heavily used meme format. Here the messaging points at religious (Hindu) victimization even though the group is a vast majority
in the country. This is a classic example of Trendification. Source: @indic\_history\_memes, ‘Govt’s involvement in protecting Hindu temple and civilization’, 2021, Instagram Post,
<https://www.instagram.com/p/CM3wFp4Bl82>.](/Users/c.c.arkenbouthva.nl/Documents/GitHub/CriticalMemeReader/imgs/18.5.jpeg)

<br/>


###  Virtuous Imagery

Associating an idea with positive and emotive language. Juxtaposing an
ideological message with euphoric or cheerful imagery.

![ Fig. 6: ‘Nudes…? No girl. The meme (fig.6) is a reference to the popular culture of sharing nudes.
However, this is depicted as a ‘vice’, and doing pooja (engaging in worship) is depicted as a ‘virtuous’ act. The aesthetic used is of a popular AR filter and the imagery is of a young Hindu monk. Source: @rastrawadi\_dank\_memes, ‘Nudes…? No Girl’, 2021, Instagram Post, <https://www.instagram.com/p/CNkgd-4hfxp>](/Users/c.c.arkenbouthva.nl/Documents/GitHub/CriticalMemeReader/imgs/18.6.jpeg)

<br/>

![Fig. 7: Soldiers performing worship infographic\
The meme is from a popular right-wing page with over 16.1k followers. This meme consists of two ‘virtues’: those of religiosity and military patriotism. The mixed message hopes to point at how the ‘brave’ soldiers
are engaging in Hindu prayer at theIndia-Pakistan border. Source: @bharatarashtra, Soldiers performing worship infographic, 2021, Instagram Post, <https://www.instagram.com/p/CNpOeTyBij7/>](/Users/c.c.arkenbouthva.nl/Documents/GitHub/CriticalMemeReader/imgs/18.7.jpeg) 

<br/>

###  Deceptive Simplification

Using *glittering generalities,*[^19chapter18_19] to falsely prove ideological
arguments. Oversimplifying complex, nuanced realities to incite a change
in viewpoint.

![Fig. 8: Hindu vs. Muslim reaction meme. This meme is an example of an over-simplistic and vague comparison of two incidents. It depicts two personalities with different religious affiliations conveyed through their background colours (saffron being Hindu, green being Muslim). However, the meme is a jab at liberals and
claims that in their eyes only Muslims have ‘freedom of speech’ while Hindus do not. This is a case of *Hindu-victimisation* and whataboutism. Source: @burnol\_wala, Hindu vs. Muslim reaction meme, 2021, Instagram
Post, <https://www.instagram.com/p/CNxh-fjj-q8/>](/Users/c.c.arkenbouthva.nl/Documents/GitHub/CriticalMemeReader/imgs/18.8.jpeg)

<br/>

### Conditioning or ‘Brand Recall’

Repetitive use of symbols combined with different visual stimuli to
condition a consistent reaction to those stimuli. Some recurrent Hindu
Right-Wing symbols include ‘saffron flags’, the slogan of ‘Hindu
Rashtra’ and hashtags like \#hinduculture, \#hindulivesmatter, etc.

Co-opting conventionally left-wing aesthetics (e.g. social justice
slideshows on Instagram[^19chapter18_20]) to propagate a right-wing agenda. Driven
by transfer of association of the visuals they imitate, such memes
establish the credibility of their content.

![Fig. 9: ‘Can you go with me?’ In Fig. 9 the meme shows a mob climbing on top of the Taj Mahal and waving a saffron flag as a display of their domination. The meme is meant to be an attack on this monument because it was built by a Mughal ruler (the entire Mughal empire being a symbol of Islamic oppression of Hindu India according to the Hindu right-wing ideology). By using the recurring imagery of Hindu ideology (saffron flags) the meme tries to dissociate its gruesome context. This visual recall helps in endorsing views under the guise of subscribing to this ideology. It also uses Trendification (1) as a visual style in the form of its pink glitter filter which gives it a Tik Tok aesthetic. It’s worth pointing out the photo is a direct reference to the Insta-famous ‘hand-holding’ couple. Source: @jai\_mahakal1, “Can you go with me?”, 2021, Instagram Post, <https://www.instagram.com/p/CNsNq4YBmGW/>](/Users/c.c.arkenbouthva.nl/Documents/GitHub/CriticalMemeReader/imgs/18.9.jpeg)

<br/>

### Cognitive Dissonance

When the repetitive association of two conflicting ideas is employed in
propaganda, people tend to either accept both ideas or refuse both of
them. One recurrent approach is to associate a popular celebrity with an
unpopular idea, forcing viewers to either reject the celebrity or accept
the idea.

Another approach is disinformation combined with false imagery in the
form of image manipulation, deepfakes etc. to create false visual
association. This can also be achieved by cherry picking content.

![Fig. 10: Sundar Pichai on NEET exam. In fig. 10, we see a viral image that was being circulated to show
Google CEO Sundar Pichai’s opinion on the NEET exam (a medical entrance exam in India). The image includes the logos of the *Copenhagen University Press, Google* and *The Business Outsider.* However, Sundar Pichai reportedly never said any of the given text[^19chapter18_21] *Copenhagen University Press* has no association with this statement either and the name and website of *The Business Outsider* seeks to emulate another much more credible and well-known website called *The Business Insider*. These three elements add a touch of legitimacy to this viral and false image.](/Users/c.c.arkenbouthva.nl/Documents/GitHub/CriticalMemeReader/imgs/18.10.jpeg)

<br/>

### Red Herring & Pseudo-Scientific imagery

Memes deploying this strategy present data or issues that, while
compelling, are irrelevant to the argument at hand, and then claiming
that it validates the argument. Often coupled with imitation and
association transfer, pseudo-scientific imagery is used to validate hoax
claims and fake news. This is done through diagrams, scientific-looking
visuals, made-up testimonies of projected experts, other similar
techniques.

![Fig.11.1: Value of Semen.](/Users/c.c.arkenbouthva.nl/Documents/GitHub/CriticalMemeReader/imgs/18.11.1.jpeg)

<br/>

![Fig.11.2: Formation of Semen. The Fig.s 11.1 and 11.2 are slides from a post claiming unverified facts
and a hoax theory (11.1) by using anatomical diagrams (11.2) to appear scientific. The claim cites Ayurveda[^19chapter18_22] as logic for this theory and calls to reject so-called western notions on the subject. Source: @snaatanhindutva, Value of Semen Infographic, 2020, Instagram Post, <https://www.instagram.com/p/CHw-KnBAEJH/>](/Users/c.c.arkenbouthva.nl/Documents/GitHub/CriticalMemeReader/imgs/18.11.2.jpeg)

<br/>

![Fig. 11.3: Darwin x Dashavatara. In this second example, the meme is trying to establish a supposed link between the chain of evolution and the different avatars of the hindu god Vishnu. By juxtaposing arbitrary creatures on a timeline, the meme tries to imply that the Hindu mythological concept of ‘Dashavatara’ had foretold and preceded Darwin’s theory of evolution.

### Cute-ification

While this tactic may seem to overlap with Trendification, its
widespread nature, excessive usage and various subgenres require the
creation of a separate category. This tactic involves presenting
messages embedded in cute pop cultural references. The bite-sized format
of cute, aesthetically pleasing memes distances you from the grotesque
facts, thereby warping your perception of reality.

![Fig.12: Har Har Mahadev X Doge. In the meme above, we see the character Doge asking the viewer what is stopping them from saying ‘Har Har Mahadev’– originally a religious Hindu mantra. The meme is a reference to a political speech where the phrase was used as a jab at the opposition (for having contested the use
of religious slogans in politics). It undoes this political connotation by presenting it with the Doge meme and cute emojis. Source: @proudhindu\_, Har Har Mahadev X Doge, 2021, Instagram Post,
<https://www.instagram.com/p/CM2T9PRBRQL/>.](/Users/c.c.arkenbouthva.nl/Documents/GitHub/CriticalMemeReader/imgs/18.13.jpeg)

<br/>

### Trivialization

The use of imagery to imply something is unimportant or not worthy of
attention. Using common jokes, cartoons and rage comics to dismiss and
trivialize oppressed groups, the opposition and critique.

![Fig. 13: Indian Transgender people x Tom and Jerry. In this example, we see Indian transgender people being equated to the cartoon Tom, insistently asking for something. This is a jibe at transgender people who beg due to forced systemic poverty. By depicting their plight in the form of a cartoon-based meme, all nuance and attempts to understand the issue are discarded. The entire Indian transgender community is thus alienated and reduced to mere fodder for humor. Source: Reserved Memes for Dalit Teens, Indian Transgenders X Tom and
Jerry, 2019, Facebook Post, <https://www.facebook.com/Dalitsenpai/photos/610210472788608">.](/Users/c.c.arkenbouthva.nl/Documents/GitHub/CriticalMemeReader/imgs/18.14.jpeg)

<br/>

## Social media strategy

It is important to point out that the potency of these visual tactics is
also due to the social media management tactics that accompany them. One
of these strategies involves interspersing different types of content.
This consists of posting memes about a plethora of topics, with varying
degrees of political commentary, sometimes completely apolitical.
Through such posting tactics, one can microdose political content
between lots of general, humorous internet content and get new followers
to engage with the account. Another phenomenon that works in the favor
of provocative visual memes is the relationship between novelty and
virality on social media. A study conducted by researchers at MIT found
that fake news travels faster on social media than the truth, and it is
humans who are majorly responsible for this rather than bots. As the
authors put it, ‘False news \[is\] more novel than true news,’ and
people are ‘more likely to share novel information’.[^19chapter18_23]

Finally, the crude, rapid, and easily modifiable format of memes makes
them very easy to create and consume. These social media management
techniques ensure visibility to a wide audience, and the aforementioned
visual tactics ensure maximum impact on each of the people who make up
this audience.

## Memes of Mass Destruction

The Jadugora lynching incident mentioned at the beginning of this
article was one amongst several examples of the real life consequences
of viral content. The gravity of the threat can be gauged from the fact
that even a tech giant like Facebook fears for the security of its
employees,[^19chapter18_24] who face the genuine threat of a violent backlash for
action against Facebook pages belonging to Hindu nationalist militant
organizations such as Bajrang Dal.

Should we be worried when a 17-year-old (a minor according to Indian
law) was motivated to pick up a loaded weapon and attack a crowd in the
presence of a platoon of police officers?[^19chapter18_25] Some might argue he was
just an angry ‘protester’ but his Facebook tells a story of a young mind
radicalized by malicious propaganda: the content he consumed in turn
consumed him. A shocking incident, but can we really say we didn't see
it coming?

![Fig.15: Screenshot from the perpetrator’s Facebook page right before he pulled out the gun. He uses the prefix ‘*Rambhakt*’ (which translates to
a worshiper of the Hindu god Ram). Source: Screenshot of ‘Rambhakt’s’ Facebook post, the 17-year-old shooter at Jamia Milia Islamia University is posing with a gun, 2020, News Article, <https://thediplomat.com/2020/02/jamia-millia-shootout-making-of-a-hindutva-terrorist/>](/Users/c.c.arkenbouthva.nl/Documents/GitHub/CriticalMemeReader/imgs/18.15.jpeg)

In Freedom House’s *Freedom in the World 2021* report, India had its
status a s a ‘free’ nation downgraded to ‘partly free’ due to what they
describe as ‘a multiyear pattern in which the Hindu nationalist
government and its allies presided over rising violence and
discriminatory policies affecting the Muslim population and pursued a
crackdown on expressions of dissent by the media, academics, civil
society groups, and protesters’.[^19chapter18_26]

In the post-pandemic age, the boundaries between online and physical
spaces are blurring. This fusion of space also implies the merging of
battlegrounds: farmers protesting at the Tikri Border in Delhi, the
blitzkrieg of hashtag trends on Twitter, anti-lockdown protesters at
Museumplein in Amsterdam, QAnon militants fighting comment battles under
2021 US insurrection videos in the Youtube comment section, Redditors
LOLing over a coup in Myanmar accompanied by an aerobics routine…

This surreal, entertaining, scary, and numbing juxtaposition of
realities is nothing but a war between truths, and the weapons of this
war are memes of mass destruction*.*[^19chapter18_27]

[^19chapter18_14]: A rough literal translation of ‘Hindu rashtra’ would be a ‘Hindu
    Nation’. But the term is a complex concept because of the different
    interpretations of the word ‘Hindu’. Some interpret the word as
    meaning ‘anyone from or living in the geographical territory of
    India’ and thus having no religious connotation. Others say it
    implies a monolithic state based on the Hindu religion: this
    interpretation is attributed to sections of the book ‘We or Our
    Nationhood Defined’ by M. S. Golwalkar, a renowned figure of the RSS
    and the historical right-wing in India. For more on the current
    political context of the term, see:\

[^19chapter18_18]: On 10 February, 2021, a man named Rinku Sharma was murdered by
    stabbing. The case was highly publicized due to the disputed claims
    of the motivations behind the murder. Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), a
    right-wing organization associated with the RSS claimed Rinku Sharma
    was killed in response to him collecting funds for a local temple.
    This claim gave rise to a huge online discourse about Hindus being
    threatened in India. See: Jignasa Sinha, “Rinku Sharma Murder Case:
