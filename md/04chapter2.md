# **The ‘Grotesque’ in Instagram Memes**

###İdil Galip

The *grotto* is damp. It is cavernous and dark, existing between life
outside and the molten core of the underground. The serpentine foliage
on the walls represents an abject reality, animals, plants, bodies,
symbols melding together *crypt*ically. The images are so comedic and
inescapably wretched that it makes you want to weep with anguish, and at
the same time produces frenzied laughter from deep within your belly
that echoes incessantly in the crypt. The *grotto* is bizarre, and so is
your laughter—it is an uncanny feeling that can only be described as
*grotto-esque*.

If the Emperor Nero knew that *Domus
Aurea*, the golden palace he built in Rome, was initially thought to be
a mere grotto, a mysterious devotional cave, he would have probably set
fire to Rome a second time. This once extravagant palace had been built
over by Nero’s successors and was only accidently rediscovered in the
15^th^ century when a young man fell through a crevice in one of the
seven hills of Rome, upon the *Oppius* spur. It was a bizarre, cavernous
world, stripped of its jewels and luxury, left only with a perplexing
array of murals depicting flora, fauna, and viscera. The story is that
following the rediscovery of the palace during the Renaissance, these
images prompted the coining of the term *grotesque*, meaning
‘grotto-like’, to describe ‘frivolously’ pagan and uncanny aesthetics.
This, of course, does not imply that the grotesque did not exist prior
to and outside of the Renaissance, the *Domus Aurea*, the Roman Empire
or ‘the West’. In fact, the grotesque appears throughout human culture,
from *Topeng* dance in Indonesia, the *Haka* in Maori culture, to the
mania of *Hacivat* and *Karagöz* in Turkish shadow play, as well as in
modes of expression and experience in contemporary digital culture [^04chapter2_1]. While the term might have been inspired by this accidental
discovery and the vestiges of a Roman past, the aesthetic form itself is
monstrously human.

## A Digital Carnival

Beyond the story of the golden palace and its curious murals, the
grotesque and in particular the literary trope of *grotesque realism* is
also closely associated with the carnival and *carnivalesque* folk
humor. Mikhail Bakhtin’s 1965 book *Rabelais and His World* details the
subtext of grotesque realism not only through literature but within the
‘structure of life’ that encompasses culture, art, everyday politics,
economic relations and mundane sociality. These carnivals Bakhtin refers
to are those that are firmly rooted in medieval Europe. They are part of
a season of feverish festivities that precede the solemn suffering of
Lent, and give ordinary people a final chance to revel in debauchery and
parody before they are engulfed by the ordeal of penance. The rituals,
performances, jokes and laughter of the carnival stand in active
opposition to ecclesiastical piety and aristocratic etiquette, and they
belong to a world that firmly rejects conventional civility. During the
carnival, social hierarchies are toppled and replaced by a mode of
expression that favors marginalized and traditionally silenced
voices.[^04chapter2_2] In this upside-down domain, those with the least economic,
political and social power enjoy attention and prominence. Holquist
(2009) exclaims that carnival has revolutionary potential.[^04chapter2_3] As it
seems to offer a glimpse into a mutinous reality where norms are debased
with the utmost fervor, and where civilians get to first wear and then
desecrate the costume of the rich and powerful.

As with the grotesque, it is important to underline that even though
Bakhtin puts the carnival in a mainly medieval European context, where
the season of the carnival is sanctioned by the Church, the spirit of
the carnivalesque derives ‘from a force that preexists priests and kings
and to whose superior power they are actually deferring when they appear
to be licensing carnival’[^04chapter2_4]. The carnival is, then, a set of
festivities created and enjoyed by ordinary folk. It is a set of
festivities that take place within the larger economic and political
structures set forth by the ruling class. It is, in its core, a response
to these structures, a reaction bursting with merriment, anger, fear,
anticipation, hope, satire and irony. Within these parameters, civilians
are allowed to parody their misery and to make money off it. The
economic element of the carnival, coupled with performance, sociality
and the all-consuming affective atmosphere, makes it so that the
carnival becomes more than a mere spectacle and a complete experience,
as it is not only ‘seen by the people’ but ‘they live in it’[^04chapter2_5]. If the
carnival is more than a holiday, a period in the calendar dictated by
the Church, then it is a mood, a reaction, and a liminal space between
reality and its reproduction. The concept of the carnival can be taken
out of its Bakhtinian context, abstracted and applied elsewhere.

On the internet, for instance, an incessant carnival rages on,
unstoppable and full to the brim with vulgar marketplace language,
grotesque performances, bodily debasement, political parody, and
laughter for laughter’s sake. The forms of folk culture that emerge from
the carnival, ‘ritual spectacles, comic verbal compositions, and various
genres of billingsgate’[^04chapter2_6] are all represented to their full extremes
online. Within the constraints of digital infrastructures controlled by
powerful tech corporations and maintained by low-paid casualized
workers[^04chapter2_7], ordinary folk are allowed to feel a simulacrum of symbolic
power. Through various carnivalesque performances, such as public pranks
and outrageous ‘story-time’ videos on YouTube, elaborate choreographies
on TikTok, Twitter ‘dunks’, and grotesque memes on Instagram, civilians
can engage and entertain other ordinary folk.

The carnivalesque is inextricably tied to the concept of ambivalent,
all-encompassing *festive laughter* and the crude language of the
marketplace, or *billingsgate*.[^04chapter2_8] Festive laughter, Bakhtin muses, ‘is
not an individual reaction to a single “comic” event’, but is ‘universal
in its scope’ and ‘ambivalent’.[^04chapter2_9] Online, internet memes evoke festive
laughter because they build on not only one comic event or themselves in
solitude, but on a myriad of texts, references and online ‘discourse’.
The more intertextually layered the meme becomes, the more it asks of
its viewer. The viewer must be embedded and fluent in deep internet lore
to find enjoyment in the meme, and to be able to set some ironic
distance between herself and her position on the internet. The proximity
between herself and digital culture is funny, spending time on the
internet is funny, and being so fluent in the internet that she can
understand even the most nonfigurative meme is funny. The meme-maker is
also hyperaware of the relationship between her audience and her meme,
and creates a communion of laughter that involves those who understand
and excludes those who cannot. As with festive laughter, meme-laughter
is also ambivalent, laughing with and at itself: after all, she ‘who is
laughing also belongs to it’.[^04chapter2_10] Digital festive laughter multiplies
ceaselessly instead of being limited to the temporal confines of the
physical carnival. While digital markets, where virality, engagement and
online visibility is both the currency and the object of transaction,
generate a boundless and rhizomatic digital marketplace talk. Grotesque
memes are borne of this digital billingsgate and never-ending festive
laughter.

## Grotesque Memes

In *The Female Grotesque,* Mary Russo makes a distinction between two
forms of the grotesque, the comic grotesque which she associates with
the work of Bakhtin and the grotesque as uncanny which she mainly links
to Freud’s discussion of feelings of unease and fear in his essay The
Uncanny’ and Wolfgang Kayser’s book *The Grotesque in Art and
Literature*.[^04chapter2_11] She posits that while Bakhtin is interested in the
social body in his discussion of the comic grotesque, the grotesque as
uncanny is ‘is related most strongly to the psychic register and to the
bodily as a cultural projection of the inner state’.[^04chapter2_12]

![Figure 2: Meme captioned ‘you were merely sent to horny jail, I was born in it - molded by it’ (Instagram: @todaywasmybirthday, 2020a). Reproduced by permission of @todaywasmybirthday.](imgs/2.2.jpeg)

<br/>

Within my digital ethnography of a community of meme artists on
Instagram, I encountered expressions of both comic and uncanny
grotesque. This *grotesque as a meme response* could be connected to
many meme makers’ experience of precarity. For instance, almost all of
the 11 meme makers I interviewed during my fieldwork could be described
as precarious workers in some sense. At the time of our interviews, many
were working multiple jobs, often as freelancers, creative consultants,
service, hospitality and manual workers, in order to survive. The job
precarity they experienced was two-fold, firstly due to an inconsistent
revenue stream from their creative work and secondly because of the
possibility of physical risk, as a result of physically laborious work.
During an interview, one participant—a meme artist with a large
following—relayed to me that he had sustained a workplace injury during
his work as a package loader for a major delivery and logistics company.
In addition to his injury, which came as a result of having to lift up
to 30 to 60 kilograms at a time, he was also being harassed and
intimidated by management. He later filed a grievance with his union and
kept his work doing ‘light duty’, as he had no other alternative,
especially during a pandemic. His experiences as a working artist, meme
creator and a blue-collar worker is not an exception, as many I talked
to in this community were employed in multiple sectors with a varying
but ever-present degree of precarity.

Beyond this sense of *platform-captivity* made worse by precarity, a
theme of in-betweenness is found in these meme makers’ relationship to
platform capital. The meme makers who I interviewed, as creators of
subversive and grotesque memes, occupy an in-between state of platform
productivity and platform resistance. They are *productive* users on
Instagram, as they perpetuate the creation of capital for the platform.
They actively create and post memes, and use platform functions that
amplify, circulate and monetize content. At the same time, they push
back against the platform by ‘deliberately seeing what \[they\] can get
away with’ as one of my participants puts it. This *resistance*, the
pushing of platform norms towards an insular ‘carnivalesque
collectivity’[^04chapter2_13] through grotesque language[^04chapter2_14] and aesthetics comes
at the risk of complete page bans and ‘algorithmic punishment’ like the
much-speculated *shadowban*. The policing of this performance of the
grotesque is ultimately at odds with the Bakhtinian conception of the
carnival, which is theorized as a period of time where the subversion of
the political and economic status-quo is tolerated by those in power.
While there is a discernible element of the grotesque within this meme
community, their carnivalesque collectivity and grotesque media is
subject to institutional, or platform, punishment. This, alongside the
exploitation of play as ‘serious business’, complicates the
conceptualization of these spaces as digital carnivals. However, the
connection between digital marketplace-talk and the appearance of the
grotesque as a meme response is still pertinent as to how festive and
grotesque laughter as well as vulgar language can be understood within memes.

Marketplaces—especially those which are casual, non-compliant and
informal such as this one, as well as others in the wider meme economy,
are by their nature vulgar spaces. To that end, they produce their own
vulgar and crude mode of communication which also feeds into and from
the festive laughter of the continuous carnival, constantly bubbling
away on the internet. This community’s memes exhibit a self-confessed
and intentional garishness which stands in opposition to the
aspirational aesthetics of mainstream social media influencers, but they
coexist on the same platform and utilize a similar entrepreneurial
logic. They laugh at this aspirational spirit, but also laugh at
themselves for contributing to it too, in true carnivalesque fashion
(Figure 3). In its core, meme-laughter engendered by the grotesque body
and the vulgar text is ‘not simply parod\[y\]; it is no more comic than
tragic; it is both at once, one might say that it is serious’.[^04chapter2_15]

![Fig. 3: Meme captioned ‘this meme brought to you by THIS FUCKIN GUY AAA??! 😂😂😂GET A LOaD 💦 of HIM 😂😂😂😂😂😂’ (Instagram: @lilperc666, 2020).Reproduced by permission of @lilperc666.](imgs/2.3.jpeg)

<br/>

The comedy, tragedy and seriousness of the grotesque which Kristeva
presents can be seen in Figure 3 created by artist @lilperc666. There
are many meme creators who are minoritized, and many have developed a
sense of left-leaning, radical politics as a result, which they try to
practice in both their digital and offline lives. However, their radical
politics clash unambiguously with Instagram’s aspirational and idealized
aesthetics. While being hyper-aware of the incompatibility of their
politics and their ‘digital workplace’, they are still too precarious to
completely withdraw their content, and therefore labor, from said
platform. This sense of platform-captivity is implied in Figure 3,
alongside Trump’s famously grotesque visage[^04chapter2_16].

Figure 2, on the other hand, is a meme created by artist
@todaywasmybirthday on Instagram. It shows a crying baby doll with a
clown-like upturned smile, prominent bottom teeth and lips painted
bright red. The tears streaming down the doll’s beady blue eyes have a
gelatinous, plastic quality. The bib and its clothes are an innocuous
pastel shade, overshadowed by the bizarre detail of a sloth-like
creature with watery eyes gnawing on the doll’s earlobe. The doll has an
unmistakable quality of uncanniness, and of abjection. It is
recognizable as an object but foreign within this composition. In its
most basic form, a doll is a toy for a child and the associations we
have with baby dolls are therefore of childhood and innocence. This is
why a broken doll, a doll with missing limbs, or an abandoned doll
strike a sense of despair in us. We imagine dolls coming alive with
malicious intent and revel in the horror at the idea when watching
*Annabelle,* Chucky in *Child’s Play,* and the evil clown in *The
Poltergeist.* The doll is also a ‘double’, an inanimate and foreign
reflection of the self, and ultimately a representation of uncanny
grotesque.[^04chapter2_17]

The doll, with its abject smile and its symbolism of innocence as well
as horror, is juxtaposed against a text-based joke about an artifact of
internet vernacular (de Seta 2019, Phillips and Milner 2017). The ‘go to
horny jail’ meme[^04chapter2_18] originally shows *Doge*[^04chapter2_19] hitting a slightly
deformed double of itself with a baseball bat while telling it to ‘go to
horny jail’, and is used online as a response to someone posting or
replying to sexual content. The set up in Figure 2 builds on this meme
culture reference but imposes more than its basic premise on the viewer.
Doge is absent and so is the physical violence of the baseball bat.
Instead, the doll-jester stares at the viewer bleary eyed, with a sloth
dangling from its ear like an earring, whispering ‘you cannot send me to
horny jail, I already live in a prison of my desires’. This *prison of
desires* metaphor should be a familiar one to anyone who has engaged
with popular interpretations of Buddhist philosophy[^04chapter2_20], the Dutch
symphonic metal band After Forever’s debut album *Prison of Desire*
(2001), or Plato’s *Phaedo*, in which Plato provides a ‘vivid
description of what it means for reason to be enslaved by the lower
parts of the soul’.[^04chapter2_21]

![Fig. 4: The cycles of meaning of the doll as a toy and the doll as a meme.](imgs/2.4.jpeg)

<br/>

Within grotesque memes, the use of *strange langu*age, a combination of
metaphors, rhymes, references, fuses with the *strange image*—absurd,
scary, foreign, abject—to *defamiliarize* mundane and inescapable parts
of human existence, but also viral meme formats. *Defamiliarization*
works by disrupting the ordinary and interrupts our habitual perception
of familiar forms. For instance, the doll in Figure 2 is visually
manipulated into a something outside of a child’s toy into a memetic
jester. It is then paired with a seemingly familiar meme format where
the viewer recognizes the ‘horny jail’ reference. The meme delivers on
the main sentiment of the original format, of the inability to control
sexual desires. However, the expression of the sentiment in Figure 2 is
external to the physical comedy of Doge. ‘The prison of one’s desires’
refers to the psychic torment of having sexual desires in the first
place, not of being unable to control them. In its totality, the doll as
part of the grotesque meme symbolizes *in-betweenness*: between
childhood and adulthood, innocence and guilt, and action and inertia
(Figure 4).

The logic of the grotesque meme works not by adding a clearly different
meaning to the original reference. Memes cannot be ‘permanent
referent\[s\] for those mutable complexities of life which are revealed
through \[them\]’, therefore the purpose of the grotesque meme ‘is not
to make us perceive meaning, but to create a special perception of the
object - it creates a “vision” of the object instead of serving as a
means for knowing it’.[^04chapter2_22] The disruption of the viewer’s expectations
in grotesque memes defamiliarizes the viral meme format, introducing a
different vision of the meme. Through abjection, a rejection of social
reason, the grotesque meme interrupts understandable, palatable, viral
meme logic and creates an affective communion between its viewer, its
creator and the incessant digital carnival.

## Digital Life and Grotesque Realism 

Digital life is life lived in-between, and therefore also partly in a
grotesque manner. Our various taps, scrolls, swishes and sounds make it
bodily[^04chapter2_23], but it is by no means an unconditionally embodied
experience. It can be physically lonely and virtually communal. This
in-betweenness is defined by its immediate proximity to and distance
from the physical. Beyond its gargantuan, pollutant infrastructure,[^04chapter2_24]
everyday interaction within digital life is maintained mainly by the
digits of the dominant hand, the eyes, the mind. Digital life is
undoubtedly *real*, but it exists in a liminal space between virtuality
and physicality. The trope of the *user-generator*, the *prosumer*, the
*content creator* also builds on this inherent in-betweenness. Just like
the carnival participant, users become ‘both actor and spectator \[…\]
\[passing\] through a zero point of carnivalesque activity and
\[splitting\] into a subject of the spectacle and an object of the
game’.[^04chapter2_25] In line with customary festive laughter, the meme maker
makes fun of herself, her viewer and the meme itself. The grotesque meme
is thus the object, the subject and the spectacle in one.

![Fig. 5: Meme captioned ‘Dam you felt proud to start w?? Sounds like a personal problem’ (Instagram: @todaywasmybirthday, 2020b). Reproduced by permission of @todaywasmybirthday.](imgs/2.5)

Grotesque memes are concerned with the cyclical biological processes,
such as sex, birth, death, eating, drinking, defecating, like grotesque
ritual in the context of carnival and grotesque realism and body in
literature. Even if the textual or the visual composition does not refer
to such processes outright, their affect is of an existential kind that
confronts the in-betweenness inherent to both the carnival and digital
life. The jester in Figure 4 has a far-away look in its eyes and a
droopy mouth. It is dissociated from reality either because of an
overstimulated mind, a stark realization of the human condition, or
simply because it is just not ‘alive’ anymore. The jester cannot feel
shame as it occupies a role of unashamed performance and debauchery by
its nature, but also because it is duly aware that the truth of the
human body allows no space for ‘dignity’. Figure 5 speaks of
‘herniating’ the brain and ‘squeezing out’ thoughts through an image of
a dog dressed up in a *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle* costume, wearing a
*Leonardo* mask frozen in a grimace. The grotesque body and the
oft-parodied act of defecation is now used to express something beyond
the pure biological act[^04chapter2_26]. The meme works with the principle element
of grotesque realism, degradation, which is ‘the lowering of all that is
high, spiritual, ideal, abstract \[…\] a transfer to the material level,
to the sphere of earth and body in their indissoluble unity’.[^04chapter2_27] By
likening thoughts to excrement, the abstract and idealized undertaking
of introspection is brought down to a visceral level. The fact that the
meme creator does this by using the medium of the meme, a maligned mode
of communication sometimes seen as trivial, mundane, base or unimportant
by ‘serious thinkers’, adds a further layer of grotesqueness. It also
reminds us that carnivalesque laughter is serious as much as it is
comedic and tragic.[^04chapter2_28]

The mask donned by the image of the dog in
Figure 6 is yet another reflection of the grotesque folk culture which
emerges from the digital carnival. Bakhtin has a reverence for the mask,
as to him it symbolizes the ‘most complex theme in folk culture’.[^04chapter2_29]
He notes that ‘the mask is related to transition, metamorphoses, the
violation of natural boundaries, to mockery and familiar nicknames \[…\]
it is based on a peculiar interrelation of reality and image \[…\] it
reveals the essence of the grotesque’.[^04chapter2_30] The *Leonardo* mask is a
replica of the face of a giant anthropomorphic turtle, and is worn by
another non-human actor, the obscured dog in the meme. Beady, bloodshot
eyes are added to the mask in the final collage and the image of the
costumed and masked animal is placed against a glitchy, static
background. The resulting visual composite is of a grotesque body, and
emblematic of grotesque realism in memes.

## Conclusion

In contrast to the medieval carnival, digital life is continuous and its
existence is uninterrupted by religious calendars and seasons. On the
internet, performance and spectacle multiply endlessly, as they are
available for consumption, spectatorship and participation
around-the-clock. Digital marketplaces are open 24/7, where marketplace
vulgarity and its associated mode of language swells and billows,
tirelessly feeding into and from digital carnivals. In these corners of
the internet, digital carnivals rattle and grow, in forums, online
communities, chatrooms, as well as in social media, e-commerce, digital
patronage and video-sharing platforms, creating their own grotesque
artefacts and affects. The resulting forms, modes, moods and objects of
these carnivals, past and present, are linked together by an experience
of in-betweenness. Digital life exists between embodiment and
virtuality, and the medieval carnival between penance and festivity, and
they therefore share an *affective* nucleus of liminality. True to their
in-betweenness, both create ambivalent laughter which encompasses the
object, subject and spectacle.

Grotesque memes are a part of digital folklore and emerge out of
carnivalesque alcoves online where the grotesque meme is an element of a
wider communion of ambivalent laughter.[^04chapter2_31] In this communion, the meme
as the object is not the only ‘joke’: instead it implicates subjects
such as the creator, the solitary viewer, and the larger audience, as
well as the subjects’ proximity to and position within digital culture.
The way it achieves this is through the *strange image* of the grotesque
body and the *strange language* of the digital marketplace. The uncanny
grotesque[^04chapter2_32] is expressed via the horror and discomfort of the
grotesque body, whereas the digital billingsgate textually conveys the
comic grotesque.[^04chapter2_33] Ultimately, grotesque memes defamiliarize viral
meme formats and offer us an opportunity to think about memes beyond
virality, image-macros, trends and as digital oddities.
