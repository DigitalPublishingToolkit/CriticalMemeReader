# Genes, Memes, Dreams\
\
Ivan Knapp\

Genes, Memes, Dreams. Three words which, to borrow one of Theodor
Adorno’s famous remarks, ‘are connected by more than phonetic
association’. [^27chapter26_1] To give a flavour of the way I want to think about
the relationship between, or rather, through these words, as well as the
stakes on which our present circumstances encounter them, a few lines
from William Burroughs' might help set the tone:

> The word is now a virus. The flu virus may once have been a healthy
> lung cell. It is now a parasitic organism that invades and damages the
> lungs. The word may once have been a healthy neural cell. It is now a
> parasitic organism that invades and damages the central nervous
> system. Modern man has lost the option of silence. Try halting your
> sub-vocal speech. Try to achieve even ten seconds of inner silence.
> You will encounter a resisting organism that forces you to talk.[^27chapter26_2]

The word, in Burroughs’ idiom, is indeed like a virus, possessing its
own kind of virality. In his dense and associative texts, words arrive
in sequences, tripping and folding over themselves. Words infect other
words, linking by long associative chains stretched out over
determinedly horizontal literary structures. The word in Burroughs is
thus also like the meme; often metonymic, it takes a part for the whole,
mutating by association and then appropriation.

The lines I quote from Burroughs above have also recently served as an
epigraph to an essay by David Joselit in which he argues that ‘it is now
simply a fact—we have learnt it all too well—that ‘viral’ memes and
biological viruses are coagents.’[^27chapter26_3] For Joselit, the Coronavirus
pandemic has latched onto and become coextensive with an epidemic of
fake news—a degrading of information in which memes are deeply
implicated for the role they have played in assaulting the authorization
of ‘information as knowledge’, for their unlinking of words from
reality.[^27chapter26_4] In 2019, Emily Apter wrote presciently of how memes are
mobilized by ‘channelling the epidemiological analogy to an aggressive
virus and all that comes with it: imaginaries of disease, contamination,
toxicity, and demographic incursion’.[^27chapter26_5] ‘The episteme of the meme’,
she continued, ‘is essentially pandemic and bellicose’.[^27chapter26_6]

For Richard Dawkins, the rhyme between gene and meme was always meant to
be conceptual as well as phonetic. He was keen to emphasise that this
closeness between the two words should refer to a correspondence between
the biological and the social or cultural, by which any quantum of
genetic or cultural material is perceptible less in a singular
presentation or encounter than in a series or sequence which could be
apprehended most clearly through a vast sample. But if the gene would
make legible transgenerational mutations, then the meme as its
‘cultural’ corollary would write the intersubjective relations between .

But what about the last of these three words, the dream? How does the
dream make of the gene-meme coupling? Apter cites the meme’s association
with mass consciousness but also its ‘negative capability’.[^27chapter26_7] If we
take the ‘negative’ here to mean the underside of something, an
underside of consciousness perhaps, then the pathway to Freud’s
psychoanalytic project becomes clearer. It may be enough, to begin with,
to set out some of the most striking congruences between dreams and
memes that emerge from a reading of the *Interpretation of Dreams*. We
learn there that dreams are composed of fragments, held together by
association: they are composed of jokes, slips of the tongue, figures of
speech; they are mnemonic, partial, fleeting and transitory. Dreams are
bizarre, absurd, irrational, monstrous. They express the satisfaction of
wishes dispelling powerful anxieties. They are formed by the operations
of displacement, condensation, revision and substitution. And, like
internet memes, they were first elevated to an object of critical
inquiry from a derided status within the culture at large.[^27chapter26_8] In sum,
one might go so far as to say that at the level of vocabulary, memes
speak the language of dreams.

Displacement, condensation, and revision are the three primary terms of
dream-work. Each one designates a mechanism by which an unconscious wish
or anxiety is given form, made representable to the dreamer in
disguise.[^27chapter26_9] As dreams are dreamt in images before being translated to
words, they are also essentially pictorial. But what I think is
important to emphasize here is the stress Freud places on the notion of
‘work’ to describe the way these image-making functions also represent
unconscious processes. In dreams there is always a manifest or surface
content produced by these operations which covers for its hidden or
latent meaning. With this terminology to hand, one can easily see how
the pictorial and associative means by which memes are produced resonate
with Freud’s project. But might we then ask what could be supposed by a
notion of meme-work on the level of psychical dynamics from which, in
dreams, these aesthetic processes are indivisible?

In the deadly context Joselit and Apter have in mind, Trump looms large.
Four years of a president apparently swept to office on a wave of
alt-right meme-warriors has irreversibly altered the status of the meme
as an object of political and psychic agency. As the psychoanalyst
Juliet Mitchell puts it, ‘psychoanalytic theory uses the bright colours
of pathology as seen in the clinic to grasp the duller shades of the
normative.’ [^27chapter26_10] If this is so, might not the glimmer of possibility
that alt-right examples provide be an opportunity to say something of
the psychic work memes perform? In other words, can we use the alt-right
meme as a pathological instance inscribed by the trace of operations
also present in less extreme, more generic, examples? Certainly the
alt-right’s incredulous declaration that with Trump’s ascent to the
White House in 2016 they had ‘actually elected a meme’ provides a sense
of the wish-fulfilling functions that memes perform. Surely the politics
of anxiety and fear which undergird Trump’s electoral support would
corroborate such a reading. Trump memes, in this sense, are a means of
representing—giving form to, articulating—a set of collective desires
and anxieties. The wish is at once dispersed and collected. For with
memes, we are talking of images for and of the group, and the psychic
work they perform is necessarily qua this mediation of group
subjectivity—a subjectivity which, as we see daily, manifests an
unremitting discordance.

One of the reasons why psychoanalytic theory isn’t particularly well
represented in the literature on memes may be on account of the
persistent misapprehension that it is a theory of the individual rather
than the social. And perhaps this owes something to Freud’s own language
when writing about groups. From *Group Psychology and the Analysis of
the Ego* and *Totem and Taboo* to *Moses and Monotheism* and
*Civilisation and Its Discontents,* the major texts on groups strive to
escape the image of the father and therefore remain beholden,
figuratively at least, to the centrality of the individual circumscribed
by the family unit. Unsurprisingly then, when Adorno—in his *Freudian
Theory and the Pattern of Fascist Propaganda*, or more recently, Hal
Foster, turn these ideas towards an analysis of historical or
contemporary neo-fascism, the prominence of the ‘leader’, of the
Fuhrerprinzip, remains intact.[^27chapter26_11] So, despite the revelation in *Group
Psychology* that hostility and violence are integral to the very
formation of the social, that the group is psychotic, regressive and
sustained by illusions, such moments of radical insight remain shaded in
the legacy of Freud’s work.[^27chapter26_12] A further problem in applying Freudian
theory to more recent emanations of fascistic subjectivity arises at the
level of organisation. For while Freud’s chief examples of groups—the
church and the army—may have reflected the rigid hierarchical command
structures of twentieth-century fascism, they resemble far less the
anonymous online masses that are distinguished by their de-centered and
lateral formations.

In order to escape the primacy of the individual subject as the
touchstone of analysis and to more effectively address the ‘social’
quality of memes, we might look to two French analysts whose work with
groups helps illuminate the social dimension of dreams. For Didier
Anzieu, the group is ‘like a dream’, whilst for René Kaës not only is
the unconscious structured like the group, but the group is structured
like the unconscious. The psychic situation of the group is, like the
dream situation, a repository of fantasies. The group, like the dream,
possesses its own modes of expression, its own level of thought. The
group and the dream are each ‘a place where images are transformed in
interaction’.[^27chapter26_13] Kaës calls the group a ‘dream factory’, a site of
polyphony that emerges from ‘the interdiscursivity specific to the
associative chain’.[^27chapter26_14]

> \[Dream polyphony\] describes how the dream is worked on by, and in, a
> multiplicity of spaces and times, images and voices. It integrates the
> idea of a plural, common, and shared dream space \[…\] dreams are
> formed in relation to each other and can be interpreted in terms of
> their relations of reciprocal support. The hypothesis of dream
> polyphony leads us into a ‘dream factory’ where several dream spaces
> interpenetrate, where several dreamers make signs to each other and
> make themselves heard by several dreamers and several listeners,
> internal and external.[^27chapter26_15]

If the group is like the dream, which is itself like the meme which is,
in turn, like the gene, this is a sequence which corresponds to a
particular logic of Freudian psychoanalysis. Introducing the first
edition of *The Interpretation of Dreams,* Freud writes of how the dream
‘is the first of a series of abnormal psychic formations’ whose
‘succeeding members’ are ‘the hysterical phobias, the obsessions, the
delusions’.[^27chapter26_16] What links these phobias, obsessions and delusions is a
corresponding or shared structure—a conflict at the seat of psychic
functioning whose irresolution is expressed in the form of a symptom.
The logic of the dream and the dream work thus enabled Freud to see how
the symptom of a pathology itself represented its cause. And it did so
by revealing the subject’s psychic reality: that is, the subjective
reality produced under the weight of repressed psychical structures and
unconscious processes which determine the subject’s apprehension of
shared reality or actuality.

…

To encapsulate the psychic reality the memetic alt-right offers entry
to, a well-known scene in Lana and Lilly Wachowski’s 1999 film *The
Matrix* offered a neat solution. The ‘red pill’ meme harks to the
juncture in the movie’s narrative where the central protagonist, the
aptly named Neo, is offered a choice between two pills: one red, one
blue. The latter will return Neo to his quotidian life as Thomas
Anderson, a computer programmer; the former will deliver him, with no
possibility of return, to a revelatory consciousness. Having chosen the
red pill, Keanu Reeves’ character finds his prior life revealed as a
simulation designed to hide his real existence as one nodal organism in
a vast system of techno-capitalist extraction.

As a figuration, the network is an exemplary blend of the disciplinary
convergences that shaped the modern internet. It has ascended to
supremacy as the dominant paradigm for how we compose and give shape to
the social field. It is plural, perforating, and lateral. Memes have
appeared within the imaginary of the network to limn and negotiate the
subgroups the network maps. As the red pill suggests, memes do not just
border but create psychic realities in contrast to others. Which is to
say, the network provides the figuration within which the meme, as a
formation which might express psychic conflict, emerges as a symptom.
For to be red pilled in the alt-right vernacular is to break from a
consensus of actuality toward what is deemed from the outside as outside
of sanity.

In *Walled States, Waning Sovereignty*, Wendy Brown takes up
nationalism’s present resurgence through the ‘passion for wall building’
that has accompanied the hegemony of globalisation.[^27chapter26_17] Walling, for
Brown, manifests the tensions that attend the rise of the network as a
predominant figure for the social. In the throes of its own waning,
sovereignty madly reasserts itself in what Brown parses as defense
mechanisms expressive of psychic resistance. She identifies tensions
‘between opening and barricading, fusion and partition, erasure and
reinscription’ and, relatedly, ‘between global networks and local
nationalisms, virtual power and physical power, private appropriation
and open sourcing, secrecy and transparency, territorialization and
deterritorialization’. These show that whilst states may act as
sovereign individuals, they are comprised of groups.[^27chapter26_18] Responding to
these tensions are fantasies Brown counts as ‘of the dangerous alien’,
‘an increasingly borderless world’, ‘containment’, ‘impermeability’,
‘purity, innocence and goodness’.[^27chapter26_19]

I want to pause briefly on something Anzieu says about illusions and the
power of certain figurations in the group situation. He writes that the
illusion ‘may be factually erroneous, nevertheless it is persuasive and
effective, as high powered ideas often are, because it corresponds to
the phantasised reality of the group, because it expresses, as do myths,
the transformation of the images that govern underlying forces’.[^27chapter26_20]
The illusion—the dream, in other words—is resistant to reality testing,
indeed it s all the more persuasive and effective because it does not
submit to actuality. This is, in effect, where Brown ends up at the end
of *Walled States*, invoking Freud’s conception of illusion to account
for the persistence of sovereignty’s theological dimension. Illusions in
this account ‘do not die upon being disproved’ because they are not
errors. [^27chapter26_21] They differ from anything which could be mistaken on
account of being powered by a wish which they express in the imagistic
form of a scene. Anzieu writes: ‘the group situation is thus perceived
as anxiety-arousing with the same intensity as it is perceived as
phantasy wish-fulfilment \[thereby confirming\] our notion that the
group, like the dream and the symptom, is to be linked to both wishes
and defences’.[^27chapter26_22] Necessarily, the group illusion sustains ‘a
protective regression’ which may be both ‘bewitching’ and
‘self-destructive’.[^27chapter26_23] Along this path the group succumbs to
projection and splitting, committing to a ‘vicious circle of
repetition’.[^27chapter26_24] Anzieu is telling us here a crucial part of what
psychoanalysts working with groups—notably Wilfred Bion and Hannnah
Segal in England as well as Kaës and Anzieu in France—have long known
about their object of study: namely that the group is an unstable
psychic entity prone to actively pursue the conditions of its own
destruction.

The physical constructions Brown surveys map the anxieties of the
network as it recalibrates the imaginative geography of group violence
under conditions accelerated by new media affordances.[^27chapter26_25] Far from the
only form available for its expression, walling nonetheless indexes a
condition of extreme paranoid anxiety: a behaviour, an impulse, a desire
which represents the irresolution of a conflict in the social between
the fantasy of sovereignty and unprecedented connectivity.
Psychoanalysis tells us that the irresolution of conflicting desires and
anxieties produces a pathological symptom. It is the provocation of this
essay that the meme, sharing so much with the psychic condition of the
group and the dream, may be usefully, if provisionally, apprehended
along the same thread. So, if memes offer any sort of royal road to a
more incisive appreciation of how our technological conjuncture
reimagines and re-attires the pathologies of the group, they would
surely do so on account of their transmission of unconscious
communication. This would be as crucial a part of their transformation
and transmission of affects as their explicit acts of political speech.
For if memes speak not just their own polyglot vernaculars but a vast
array of other languages, verbal and non-verbal, that is not to say they
remain masters of their own tongue and invulnerable to it slipping. In
such ways, memes un-contain fantasies as much as they contain them. And
if memes also collectivise fantasy, inasmuch as they articulate the many
voices which comprise the unconscious, such a perspective would read the
meme as a medium of peculiar susceptibility to the representation of
fantasies which index the pathological dimensions of everyday life.

In the final chapter of her first major work on male hysteria (a subject
whose pertinence to the alt-right meme there is, unfortunately, no space
to expand on here), *Mad Men and Medusas*, Mitchell offers an
intriguing, if all too brief, speculation to this discussion. ‘Between
the nightmare and the dream’, she writes, ‘are bad dreams’.[^27chapter26_26] Bad
dreams, she suggests, are survival dreams, yet what haunts them
originates in fantasy. They are dreams in which the subject struggles
manically to cope with the threat of his annihilation, to contain that
violence within the envelope of the dream. Bad dreams are also confused
dreams, caught between wish fulfilment and the escape of waking up (the
being allowed to ‘die safely’ that the nightmare offers its traumatised
dreamer.) They feel extremely real, with the quality of those states
just before we wake or fall asleep. ‘In a good dream, the ego is mobile,
occupying different people in different stances’.[^27chapter26_27] In a bad dream,
however, ‘this ego mobility is excessive, frantic and bizarre’.[^27chapter26_28] Bad
dreams, are ‘full of incongruous juxtapositions suggesting the
iterativeness and compulsiveness of the \[dream’s\] strategy’.[^27chapter26_29] The
‘ego is not mobile so much as driven from pillar to post’.[^27chapter26_30] The bad
dream, it turns out, is a peculiarly intense and illicit dream. It is a
high-stakes dream in which anxieties and desire are wrapped ever more
tightly around each other to impede the work of the censor. The bad
dream puts the mechanisms of dream-work into overdrive. The system, it
seems, can barely cope. What is worse, from these dreams, one doesn’t
wake up.

In considering what this relationship between the dream and memes might
let on to, I would recommend not collapsing the differences between the
two terms. Instead, any correspondence might be more helpfully directed
toward the way memes could help us think about the group as a psychic
object. This would be a perspective set against the algorithmic culture
which fosters its own illusions about the extent to which the group can
be analysed empirically, and which has now attracted around its
methodologies familiar categories of the neuroses.
