#Dear Mr.BoneSaw your face smells like a chicken shawarma: A Clapback to Saudi Arabia’s Electronic Army

###Saeeda Saeed

Hello:) My pseudonym is Saeeda Saeed, and I’m an e-activist from Saudi
Arabia. This is the story of how I came to devise an Instant Meme Noise
Generator that spews out nonsensical insults to the top 10 Saudi
state-run Twitter accounts. In 2019, I came to the Netherlands to
undergo my very first art residency. That summer, I bought myself a
FlixBus ticket from Maastricht to Paris. As the bus stopped over at a
gas station, I opened my backpack and pulled out several smartphones to
test run my shady looking troll farm. I then noticed the bus driver
walking towards me with a concerned look on his face. He asked, ‘Ma’am
what are you up to? What are all those phones for?’ I took a deep
breath, channeled all the artists that I’d been hanging out with over
the last 6months and blurted out, ‘This is a performance art piece!’
Right then and there I witnessed his body language shift from fear and
concern to fascination and curiosity as he warmly replied, ‘Oh how
interesting! Where will this be exhibiting? Do you need any help setting
up?’ I remember thinking, ‘woah I wonder what else could I get away with
by contextualizing my activism within the arts?’ What would happen if I
injected methods of play, performance, fiction and humor into my
activism? Whilst humor has long been used as a tool against oppression,
with the emergence of digital technologies memes have become renowned
for their ability to perform criticism through humor and satire. This
draws parallels to a Foucauldian understanding of ‘disqualified
knowledges’ or the local popular knowledge in which criticism performs
its work. In this essay, I reflect on the use of internet memes as a
means to collectivize power, to shift the on-going political narrative,
to drown out official state-run tweets, to vent and express frustration
directly towards state institutions that have prosecuted, harassed and
silenced critical voices within the Saudi authoritarian regime.

## The Rise of Hypernationalism in Saudi Arabia

Imagine an electronic dance music festival with DJ David Guetta remixing
pro-regime patriotic songs: the crowd goes wild when the beat drops on
the lyrics ‘LONG LIVE THE SALMANS.’[^15chapter13_1] 

Prior to gaining the nickname Mr.BoneSaw, the crown prince Mohammed
Bin Salman—also known as MBS—was quick to gain the support of the Saudi
transnational google generation aged 15 to 34 which make up 36.7% of the
population.[^15chapter13_2] Upon his anointment in April 2017, he led several
successful reforms that vastly altered the socio-political atmosphere of
the country. These include legislation that limits the power of the
religious police, the removal of the ban on female driving in June 2018
and the weakening of the male guardianship system in 2019. Also in line
with the rebranding of the state is the ‘Saudi Vision 2030’ campaign: an
economic plan to increase public spending and reduce the country’s
dependency on oil, which meansamplifying the entertainment and tourism
sectors.

However, the very same millennial ruler who organized EDM festivals also
knew the extent to which algorithmic feed based platforms like Twitter,
Facebook and Youtube could be used as an instrument to monitor what the
people were thinking and writing, and to use it as a tool to control
and/or dampen the on-going political narrative. In November 2017, a new
anti-terrorism law stated that simply 'retweeting’ anything that goes
against the state, the establishment, or religion can be punishable by
1000 lashes and a 10-15 year jail sentence. The state then installed two
Twitter moles that released IP addresses and contact details of more
6000 twitter accounts.[^15chapter13_3] Soon after, Turki bin Abdul Aziz Al-Jasser
was arrested and tortured to death in March 2018 for allegedly running a
Twitter account called Kashkool, which exposed human rights violations
by Saudi authorities. In May and August of 2018, several female
activists were arrested and subjected to torture and sexual abuse during
their detention.[^15chapter13_4] Shortly after followed the murder and dismemberment
Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018.[^15chapter13_5]

Does a Pseudonym protect you from the \#Blacklist? No.

The state has ways of finding the real person

There are many ways to figure out an IP address

A secret. I will not reveal.

Above is an example of a national twitter intimidation campaign launched
in 2018 titled \#BLACKLIST where MBS’s aide Saud Al Qahtani tweeted that
‘No one who conspires against countries imposing the \[Qatari\] boycott
will be spared from prosecution even if they say they were forced. And
those with pseudonyms won’t be spared either.’ The campaign invited
citizens to become accomplices in identifying and tagging a person to be
put on the Blacklist, thus making citizens an arm of the state’s efforts
to control the population. Qahtani was also known to mobilize a group of
social media specialists known as the Army of Flies, tasked with
creating thousands of fake twitter accounts that posed as young Saudis
showing support for the future King, targeting and shaming anyone who
thought otherwise. This marks the beginnings of a new hypernationalist
movement that promotes the veneration of rulers both online and offline,
suppressing critical voices and stifling reports on the war in Yemen.

## Replatforming

In their manifesto *Xenofeminism: A Politics for Alienation*, Laboria
Cuboniks describes the paradigm shift in contemporary social media as,
‘If ‘cyberspace once offered the promise of escaping the strictures of
essentialist identity categories, the climate of contemporary social
media has swung forcefully in the other direction, and has become a
theatre where these prostrations to identity are performed. With these
curatorial practices come puritanical rituals of moral maintenance, and
these stages are too often overrun with the disavowed pleasures of
accusation, shaming, and denunciation*.*’[^15chapter13_6]

The online and offline hypernationalist movement silenced a massive wave
of critical voices across the nation, including my own. Upon witnessing
numerous examples of collective punishment of family members of
e-activists who remained in the Kingdom, I chose to not only operate
under a pseudonym but to gear my practice towards developing safer
methods to counter-tweet the state. a Twitter users have become
increasingly afraid of conveying support for outspoken critics; this has
largely lead to them taking down their twitter accounts or
self-censoring.

However, self-censorship in Saudi Arabia—both in the past and the
present day—has never meant that people were silent. It has just meant
that they’ve found different avenues to channel their thoughts. I’d
argue that Saudi citizens and expats living in Saudi Arabia have long
mastered the skill of replatforming, both online and offline. Kana
Makiya, author of the book *The Monument,* studies the memetics of
visual displays of power and dominance on the ground in urban
landscapes. He describes sculptures and paintings of former Iraqi ruler
Saddam Hussain blown up to almost God-like, non-human proportions and
placed in public spaces, serving as a reminder of who is in power.[^15chapter13_7]
This virtually unspoken yet constantly looming reminder led people to
self-censor in public, retreating to self-organized and mobilized
underground physical safe spaces.

![Fig. 1: Image Source: Whisper App @Yellow_Net](/Users/c.c.arkenbouthva.nl/Documents/GitHub/CriticalMemeReader/imgs/13.1.jpeg)

<br>

A similar pattern is reflected online where users are seemingly silent
but are actually in constant movement searching and replatforming on to
the next latest app that purportedly offers more privacy until it gets
discovered and taken down by the Saudi CITC (Communications and
Information Technology Commission) and the cycle repeats. ‘I love my gay
community in Jeddah’, says a post found on Whisper in 2012, an app that
gained quite a bit of traction due to its feature of anonymously posting
text and image. Snapchat followed, gaining popularity soon after, in
2015. Most recently, Saudi users have replatformed onto Clubhouse,
hosting rooms under the topics of ‘Racism in Saudi Arabia’,
‘Legalization of Alcohol in Saudi Arabia’ and ‘Stories of Surveillance
under MBS’ only to find pro-government Saudi Twitter accounts taking
screenshots and recording conversations from among those in the room,
noting down their identities, threatening and shaming everyone
involved.[^15chapter13_8] The fast pace of crackdowns on apps makes replatforming a
short-lived strategy without the ability to gain much traction.

So not only does replatforming lessen reach, but it also subjects users
to harassment and possible detainment. Butwhat triggers certain posts to
be flagged? And what types of posts manage to stay under the radar? IP
Blocking, Keyword filtering, DNS poisoning, and manual enforcement are
just some methods the state uses to flag content. Tweeting or retweeting
any content that directly calls out the government, the ruling family,
or religion is typically flagged within 24 hours.

## The Clapback

Whilst scrolling through my TikTok explore page I find a deep fake of
King Salman singing along to Ping Fong’s Baby Shark:it dawns on me that
the type of content that doesn’t get taken down usually comes in the
form of memes. Authorship is one of the reasons memes don’t get taken
down, as remix culture allows for memes to shapeshift and adapt to
different narratives. American blogger and internet activist Ethan
Zuckerman formed what is known as the ‘Cute Cat Theory’ where he creates
a dichotomy between users who share pictures of their cats and those who
engage in political activism. In many ways, both messages leverage the
same tools, but they differ intrinsically stating that ‘\[Web 1.0\] as
designed by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN, was intended to let physicists
share research findings online…With Web 2.0, the web became a space for
the creation and dissemination of amateur content. The contemporary
Internet was designed, in no small part, for the dissemination of cute
pictures of cats.’[^15chapter13_9] In her book *Memes to Movements*, An Xiao Mina
further elaborates on the Cute Cat theory by claiming that ‘if you are
trying to censor activist messages, you will inevitably censor the same
internet that is being used to spread amateur media, the things which
people enjoy and you will inevitably upset more people than you
originally intended.’[^15chapter13_10]

The cute cat theory draws parallels with how memes in Saudi Arabia have
been used by different fringe subcultures as forms of critique. Below
are examples of memes that critiqued the former societal male
guardianship system (a law abolished in August 2019 that once forced
women to seek approval from their male guardians to travel, get married
or divorced). See also memes made by the Saudi illegal immigrant
community shedding light on police raids and most recently memes
criticizing the Saudi Covid 19 contact tracing app and lockdown
measures. All these are highly critical topics that would have been
flagged had they been framed in the form of tweets or interviews, but
dressed in the vernacular of memes they seem to be dismissed by state.
Michel Foucault touches upon the
notion of ‘disqualified knowledges’ when he writes that ‘It is through
the re-appearance of this knowledge, of the local popular knowledges,
the disqualified knowledges, that criticism performs its work.’[^15chapter13_11]

![Fig. 2.1: The covid19 contact tracing app is called Tawakalna which roughly translates to God be with you. This meme deletes the app ands write to it God be with you.](/Users/c.c.arkenbouthva.nl/Documents/GitHub/CriticalMemeReader/imgs/13.2.jpeg)

<br/>

![Fig. 2.2: Meme commenting on police raid during the nationwide crackdown on illegal immigrants](/Users/c.c.arkenbouthva.nl/Documents/GitHub/CriticalMemeReader/imgs/13.3.jpeg)

<br/>


This underlies that idea that the distance between the very serious and
very silly is quite small. The epistemology of nonsense has been used
and reused many times by various internet sub communities as a key
method of criticism. ‘Of course we make nonsense,’ states
@InRealityADream, a Tumblr account that describes the creation of memes
as 'neo-Dadaist,’ an echo of the early-20th-century art movement that
deliberately abandoned logic and coherence as a statement on the effort
it takes to make sense in a world without sense.[^15chapter13_12] The Tumblr post
that popularized this term on the platform specifically describes memes
filled with nonsense, obscure cultural references, and comments about
suffering depression, as an inescapable response to the socioeconomic
conditions young people are subject to in the 2010s.[^15chapter13_13]

American far right blogger, Curtis Yarvin (aka Mencius Moldbug) also
looks at the notion of nonsense as a powerful way to spread
disinformation, stating that, ‘in many ways nonsense is a more effective
organizing tool than the truth. Anyone can believe in the truth. To
believe in nonsense is an unforgeable demonstration of loyalty. It
serves as a political uniform.’[^15chapter13_14]

I’d argue that non-sensical memes within the context of Saudi Arabia
prove to be effective due to the fact that they are a) nonsensical and
b) do not directly address the state, the royal establishment or the
religion as stated in the Anti-terrorism law. Instead, they are dressed
in the visual vernacular of internet memes, and thus generally
disregarded as trolls being a nuisance, with little to no ramifications
other than your account being taken down.

## The Instant Meme Noise Generator

![Fig. 3: Some of the insults coded into the randomized insult generator.](/Users/c.c.arkenbouthva.nl/Documents/GitHub/CriticalMemeReader/imgs/13.5.jpeg)

<br/>

A study titled ‘Dissecting the Meme magic: Understanding Indicators of
Virality in Meme Images’ found that memes that trigger high arousal
emotions, both positive and negative, such as anger, anxiety,
exhilaration, are more like to be shared than low arousal emotions like
sadness or contentment.[^15chapter13_15] Twitter was once deemed the Saudi congress,
a space that was ours in which to discuss, share and vent. But with the
platform’s saturation by state surveillance, having no outlet to vent
and an overall feeling of helplessness in terms of gaining
accountability, I chose to make nonsensical insults aimed at Saudi’s
state-run media accounts. Inspired by Brian Gysin & William S. Burough’s
cut-up method, I started out by developing a randomized insult generator
that constructed sentences which made no particular sense, but assembled
together bore the tone of an offensive insult.

I then verbalized the insults by creating voice tracks because in my
perspective insults aren't insults until they are verbalized in our
mother tongue. During this period, I watched a lot of ASMR keyboard
videos and came across a gigantic key cap which looked incredibly
satisfying to press and so I ordered it. As soon as the package arrived,
I had all the components necessary to build the structure of my game.
This is how it worked:

The Instant Meme Noise Generator consisted of pressing one satisfyingly
large button for a total of 4 rounds; each round randomly generated
insults with the final round tagging one of the Top 10 State run Media
accounts and directly uploading the sentence on to Twitter in real time.
(In order to play log onto on to
[*https://insultgenerator.club/*](https://insultgenerator.club/))

An example randomly generated Insult:

\[round 1\] YOUR MOTHER

\[round 2\] IS UGLY ENOUGH TO SCARE

\[round 3\] MOULDED CHEESE

\[round 4\] TAG STATE MEDIA
ACCOUNT

<br/>

![Fig. 4.2: An example of a nonsensical insult generated post on Twitter.]( /Users/c.c.arkenbouthva.nl/Documents/GitHub/CriticalMemeReader/imgs/13.7.jpeg)

<br/>

Now I that I had the mechanism of the game, I needed to find out when
and which accounts I should target, and what was the most optimal way to
post and drown out official tweets.

## Discovering alternative Counterposting Strategies 

In order to develop counterposting strategies, it was crucial to
understand the infrastructure of the current Saudi cyberspace, focusing
on Twitter as the primary platform. This was done by closely monitoring
and gathering the social media metrics of the top 30 state run accounts
on Twitter over a three-month period. The task included the daily
logging of the following metrics: the frequency and timings of posts,
average response times, language, conversion rate, and sentiment
analysis. Patterns in the data helped determine potential design
opportunities to counter post alternative narratives to that of the
state. Below are a few of the findings:

-   Peak posting times for Ministries & Government entities is between
    0900-0500 as opposed to high-powered individuals who post most
    frequently between 2300-0400. These time-frames act as an indicator
    for optimal times to counterpost or generate noise to drown out
    official tweets.

-   English state-run accounts were set up post 2017 as a part of the
    state’s ‘rebranding’ campaign in the hopes of opening up Saudi
    tourism and shifting international perception. The data gathered
    from sentiment analysis shows that this plan backfired since
    accounts in English were far more susceptible to criticism &
    negative sentiment from an international audience mostly demanding
    accountability for the murder and arrests of journalists and
    activists.

-   Twitter state run accounts with low average response times indicate
    that they are not as heavily monitored and could work as potential
    spaces to post alternative narratives.

Now that I knew when and which accounts to counterpost, I could finally
start playing. The first week of trial posts came to a halt with a
notification from Twitter stating, ‘We’ve temporarily suspended some of
your account features. Your account appears to have exhibited unusual
behavior violating Twitter rules. We may suspend an account if it has
been reported to us as violating our rules surrounding abuse.’ Funnily
enough, to me, this was an indicator that my counter-tweets where
clearly working, as it seemed to have offended/triggered enough
state-run accounts to report me to Twitter. I then proceeded to set up a
number of backup Twitter developer accounts in preparation for the open
studio exhibition of the art residency I had attended in the
Netherlands. The expected footfall of the exhibition was about 3000
visitors over the course of three days. The Instant Meme Noise Generator
was installed in a dark-lit room with a giant blinking red button
tempting visitors to interact and play the role of my personal troll
army. The installation featured two screens: the interface of the
Instant Meme Noise Generator and a live Twitter feed showing the meme
insults being uploaded in real time. Over the course of three days,
small crowds of visitors gathered around the game giggling in
anticipation, sharing laughs as the generator completed the insult. I
recall a conversation between two teenage visitors: ‘Your big brother is
ugly enough to scare my boogers on a wintery day @Media\_KSA! this is
hilarious but wait, did we just assist the artist in insulting the Saudi
state?’ The other teenage visitor responds, ‘well if it’s this
satisfying to play; I’d be happy do so! C’mon one more round!’ Other
responses were slightly more hesitant and cautious, but many felt more
inclined to engage upon seeing others interact with the generator.

Over the next two weeks, I continued to play with the Instant Meme Noise
Generator, and I was able to measure the impact these nonsensical tweets
had. I was initially discouraged upon seeing that there were hardly any
retweets, however upon reviewing the analytics of just one of my twitter
accounts, I found that each of the top 10 State run media accounts
generated between 700-3000 impressions per tweet and in a day that meant
up to 600,000 impressions. Impressions on Twitter indicate a total tally
of all the times the Tweet has been seen, appearing on a user’s timeline
after being liked or commented on. On an average day where I played 200
rounds of the game, I would generate anywhere between 1.4 and 3million
impressions. Now imagine if I had used the same method as the state and
mobilized an ‘electronic army' who were each tasked to play the game as
a 9-5 job; the numbers would multiply significantly and collectively
generate a significant amount of alternative noise. An Xiao Mina
describes a ‘contest of memes’ in which these seemingly opposing
movements are learning from and co-opting each other. They are borrowing
each other’s techniques because they are learning how to influence
society. ‘We have entered a new world of memetic contention, one where
meme culture has become as much a tool for those in power as it has for
those seeking to challenge it. Movements of hate have embraced this
culture as much as movements of justice.’[^15chapter13_16]
