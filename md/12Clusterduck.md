# Le Meme d’Auteur, or: How We Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Original Content Memes

###Clusterduck (Silvia Dal Dosso, Francesca Del Bono, Aria Mag, Noel Nicolaus)

At the start of the third decade of the 21st century, while internet
Memes certainly can’t be considered a cultural novelty anymore, their
definition remains as elusive and difficult as ever. 

According to Limor Shifman, the three main attributes of memes are their
gradual propagation from individuals to society, their reproduction via
copying and imitation, and their diffusion through competition and
selection.[^10chapter8_1] Many other aspects, such as their contextual and
historical nature (the true meaning of a meme becoming clear only when
viewed in its original context, and when considering its origins and
evolution over time) or their ironic, quasi dada ethos,[^10chapter8_2] are often
proposed as discriminating factors when trying to differentiate memes
from other digital imagery.

One salient feature, however, seems to enjoy almost universal consent
when trying to characterize memes: ‘The value of a meme arises not from
the work of one author but from that of many’ according to copyright law
experts May Cheng and Maryna Polataiko.[^10chapter8_3] Memes don’t care about
copyright; memes don’t care about authorshipFrom a copyright lawyer’s
perspective, the answer clear: ‘To this day, copyright law is heavily
influenced by individualistic conceptions of authorship. Yet unlike a
literary work penned by the “author-genius”, memes are collective
creations comprising diffuse and oft-anonymous involvement’.[^10chapter8_4]

If only it were this simple.

As Clusterduck,[^10chapter8_5] we’re currently working on a project called Meme
Manifesto.[^10chapter8_6] During our research, we bumped into a cluster of images
that shattered our preconceptions about memes. They looked like memes.
They felt like memes. However, they presented with some important
differences: while often quoting or referencing popular memetic formats,
they didn’t rely on them. They weren’t playing according to the usual
rules. Sure, the basic mechanics were the same: images and texts of all
sorts, juxtaposed through remixing and collage. However, the thought and
care given to these creations was unusual. The visuals were polished,
the fonts refined. The roughness and ‘ugly’ aesthetics of these works
was clearly the result of careful work, inspired by undeniable visual
savviness. In more than one case, the quoting of artistic currents or
famous artworks was explicit, though of course masked under the usual
layers of memetic irony. Most importantly: not onl could these images
easily be traced back to their original author, individual authorship
seemed to be one of their main hallmarks.

While trying to identify these artefacts, we couldn’t help but ask
ourselves: were these *meme d’auteur*? Did we need to revise some of the
most common assumptions about the nature of memes?

We don’t want to give a final answer to this question here. Instead, we
are going to share some of our reflections and present the three lines
of investigation we have been following so far. The first is related to
platform architecture, platform politics and how these both relate to
deplatforming and community diasporas. The second is related to the
conflicts surrounding identity politics, and to the online culture wars
that arise from them. And finally, the third path is searching for hints
in contemporary revisions of the concept of social class.

## PART I: A Community gets Deplatformed

In December 2018, following accusations involving child pornography,
Apple decided to remove the microblogging platform Tumblr from its iOS
App Store, leaving its then-owner Yahoo with no choice but to
drastically restrict the presence of NSFW-content on its servers. Huge
quantities of images, from hardcore porn to female nipples (a
specification of the new community guidelines that became an instant
meme),[^10chapter8_7] were flagged and deleted overnight on very short notice.[^10chapter8_8]
The policies of the platform were thus radically altered, leading to a
removal of the well-known ‘safe mode’ function and altering the
character of Tumblr for good.

These changes had two immediate results: firstly, Tumblr was readmitted
to the App Store. Secondly, the highly influential, sex-positive queer
subcultures that had chosen Tumblr as their natural habitat were forced
to look for a new home. While many members of this community migrated to
decentralized platforms like Discord, where they can be found to this
day, and others decided to raise NSFW friendly platforms which are more
or less small Tumblr clones,[^10chapter8_9] a considerable number decided to settle
in one of the most guarded, commercialized and puritan places of the
internet: Instagram. What were we to make of this conundrum?

It was certainly not the first time in internet history that a large
group of users was suddenly forced to move *en masse* to more prosperous
lands due to a change in the community policies of the hosting platform,
a phenomenon that has sometimes been called ‘Social Media Diaspora’. One
of the first illustrious examples of such a diaspora
coincides—unsurprisingly, we might say—with the birth of 4chan. As
Whitney Phillips recounts, 4chan was ‘originally conceived in 2003 as a
content overflow site for a particularly NSFW Something Awful subforum
called *Anime Death Tentacle Rape Whorehouse*’.[^10chapter8_10] 4chan wasn’t the
only ‘spin-off’ from the comedy website Something Awful. In many Weird
Twitter users, including the famous user @dril,[^10chapter8_11] used to meet on a
Something Awful subforum called ‘Fuck You and Die’.[^10chapter8_12] These
communities, when moving from one platform to another, brought with them
styles, symbols and tones of voice, which helped their members to
recognize each other once they got to the other side. For 4chan, these
hallmarks were NSFW content, lore, and memes. For the so-called Weird
Twitter, to take another famous example, the hallmarks were the surreal,
ironic, and dark humor, and the intentionally poor quality of images.

Communities’ hallmarks are also crucial for the process of
self-identification, as shown by the case of the internet subculture
known as Vaporwave, which came to play a crucial role in the rise of
Tumblr. As Know Your Meme reports, the first article in which the Tumblr
community and the highly recognizable ‘Tumblr a e s t h e t i c’ were
associated with the Vaporwave music genre dates back to 2013.[^10chapter8_13] The
‘viral images’ associated with Vaporwave had been around on Tumblr for a
good few years already, as Tumblr users, following the open architecture
of the platform, had started to share those cute, sad, nostalgic motifs
*ad infinitum,* creating a very recognizable visual culture, something
*new* and yet already *dead* at the same time.[^10chapter8_14] In the following
years, more than a few commentators would refer to Mark Fisher’s account
of *hauntology* to describe the harrowing sense of nostalgia emanating
from these digital artefacts. In fact, some creators from the Vaporwave
community would even come to incorporate Fisher’s quotes in their works,
making the connection explicit. 

Since their inception, it has always been clear that these pics were
something different from the memes that were shared on reddit or 4chan
at the time. As told by Anothercountyheard, author of the article ‘The
Verdict on Vaporwave’: ‘I had seen these weird new graphics, and the
music was closely tied to everything I had been following since 2010.
Putting it all together, connecting the dots, I began to see this new
meme, the latest in a series of so-called micro-genres emanating from
the underground internet music cult, as nothing less than a *new
unifying aesthetic*’.[^10chapter8_15] It is no coincidence that Anothercountyheard
calls them a ‘new meme’. The first thing that catches the eye is
definitely the ‘new’ and ‘unifying aesthetics’: while unmotivational
posters, lolcats, rage comics, or advice animals respond to the
so-called ‘Internet Ugly Aesthetic’, which, as Nick Douglas explains so
well, ‘is supposed to look like shit’,[^10chapter8_16] these new images were on
some other kind of visual journey. Moreover, ‘Ugly Aesthetic’ memes
tended to be, without a doubt, the result of a collective work, a
product of the ‘Hivemind’. They were almost always made by anonymous
users, or in some cases stolen from cartoonists that used to publish
their comics on DeviantArt and MySpace, and then remixed by anonymous
users. And the 4chan and troll community certainly rewarded anonymity as
one of their first rules of conduct and original hallmarks, despising
‘namefags’ over anything else. Meanwhile, these ‘new memes’ on Tumblr
were attempting to reach something fresh, something beautiful, something
to look at for no other reason than to enjoy pure aesthetic pleasure.
Soon enough, the creators behind these works begun to reclaim them by
doing something highly unusual in the popular meme community: they
started to show their identity.

It is interesting to note how, over time, Tumblr users changed their
behaviour from a ‘free repost’ approach to a strict ‘quote the source’
approach. From the start, Tumblr’s platform architecture offered a
backtracking system: users could travel backwards from one repost to
another, in order to reach the first source. But sometimes, for the most
viral images, going backwards would be a very long and perilous travel,
or sometimes a ‘scumbag reposter’ would do a copy-pasta instead of a
proper repost. Over time, this became a problem, leading to a slow but
sure change in user behavior. As artist,performer, and active Tumblr
community member since 2012 Mara Oscar Cassiani told us in a private
conversation, it’s difficult to define whether this change was due to a
rising awareness of the flaws of Tumblr’s reposting system, or if,
instead, the shift was due to the influence that Instagram was having on
the community (more on this later). Whatever the explanation, around
2015 many users that were active both on Tumblr and Instagram realized
that they could easily monetize their online activity on Instagram,
trading online clout for fame, followers and sometimes even financial
revenues. Soon, a ‘new awareness’ spread on Tumblr. The ‘free repost’,
which until then had been the standard practice on Tumblr, turned into a
constant struggle for attribution: reposters started to receive numerous
direct messages by the original creators of popular images, asking them
to quote them properly. Soon enough, specific rules of conduct for
attributions began to appear on many platforms—not just on Tumblr, but
also Pinterest, for instance. As we will see in a bit, this aspect
remains present in the ‘unwritten laws’ of what we will call the *meme
d’auteur,*or Original Content (OC) community.

To close this short disquisition on ‘Social Media Diasporas’, we need to
mention the ‘Weird Facebook’. The birth of Weird Facebook could maybe
count as the first example of a diaspora that occurred from Tumblr to
another platform. According to Know Your Meme, ‘many of the earlier
Weird Facebook pages were used in a manner similar to Tumblr, with
simple image reposts that were not generated by any member or admin of
the meme group’.[^10chapter8_17] In other words, the Tumblr reposting and
shitposting hallmark is easily recognizable in the community that, from
2015, started to invade and derange normal Facebook users' routines.

## PART II: A War Looms Over the Horizon

It would be limiting to speak of Weird Facebook as a community of users
coming from Tumblr only. As we ourselves have had the opportunity to
experience, ‘Weird Facebook includes “art world” people, writers, 4chan
and reddit users, people who are obsessed with rare memes, IRL
influencers, social justice 'warriors', and seemingly normal people who
love shitposting on Facebook.’[^10chapter8_18]

It’s also worth noting that some of the most prolific Weird Facebook
memers, who had actually managed to make a name for themselves in the
community, later played a crucial role in bringing the scene to
Instagram. One illustrious example is Gangster Popeye, whose works were
quoted in a 2016 New York Magazine article praising Weird
Facebook.[^10chapter8_19] 

Gangster Popeye, also known by her name Bambi Terranova, initially
gained notoriety for the ferociously ironic style of her memes, usually
featuring skeletons and - according to a dedicated Fandom page -
‘edgy-sounding, “I don't take shit from anyone” statements that subvert
towards absurdly post-ironic messages of tolerance and
kindness’.[^10chapter8_20]   

In Gangster Popeye’s production, as well as in her biography as a trans
woman, many of the hallmarks that would come to characterize what we now
know as Original Content (OC) meme style were already visible.
Pop-culture references and characters, especially from cartoons or
videgames (e.g. Garfield, Sonic, Sailor Moon, Super Mario Bros), get
mixed with tropes from American political culture and usually detourned
through corrosive, surreal and provocative captions. Fonts often become
protagonists, seemingly breaking with the ‘poorly made’ style common to
most popular memes. 

There are no recognizable formats, or at least none that could be
considered exclusive to the OC community; instead, popular meme formats,
templates and characters are quoted, remixed or dissolved. There’s deep
familiarity with memetic culture, but also a detachment and
self-reflexivity that, although dissimulated through irony and black
humour, is revelatory of a different ethos and sense of belonging from
the one most commonly found among 4chan’s anons.[^10chapter8_21] Images and texts
in OC memes are frequently arranged in ways that are reminiscent of
political propaganda posters. The messages are often blunt and direct,
although dissimulated by multiple layers of irony. What we see here is a
strong underlying political message: statements are often harsh and
leave no room for misunderstanding. What are we to make of this? 

Of course, politics are no stranger to meme culture. In her influential
reading of the online culture wars that preceded Trump’s election, Irish
writer Angela Nagle draws an almost Manichean picture of contemporary
meme culture: ferocious Trump-supporting incel trolls on one side, and
enraged social justice warriors on the other side, vying for cultural
hegemony by means of memes and using 4chan and Tumblr as their
respective home turfs.[^10chapter8_22] While Nagle’s work has been criticized both
over its sourcing[^10chapter8_23] and her implicit suggestion that the Alt-Right’s
radicalization was an indirect consequence of aggression by Tumblr’s
Social Justice Warriors (an early echo of today’s controversies around
the concept of Cancel Culture), her characterization of Tumblr as the
digital home of a very lively, heterogeneous, and influential LGBTQ+
scene struck a cord and remains influential to this day.

A look at the most popular themes and tropes of the OC meme community
seems to confirm this picture: not only are many OC memes filled with
caustic references and puns about sexuality, masturbation and the notion
of gender as a social construct, but they often openly target the incel
community and stigmatize homophobic and transphobic behaviour. Together
with their openly anti-capitalist stance and peculiar aesthetics, this
activistic ethos shows how Tumblr’s spirit, in many ways, lives on in
the OC meme community.

We should also remember that the aforementioned digital culture wars are
often fought ferociously through doxxing, profile shutdowns[^10chapter8_24] and
personal attacks of the most vicious nature, with sometimes dramatic
consequences for those involved. Many members of the OC community are
part of marginalized groups (for example, people of color or trans
women), and their digital presence is often characterized by an open
discussion of topics related to mental health and depression. Their
social media profiles sometimes become the only space for them to
positively affirm their identity and build relationships with peers. It
shouldn’t come as a surprise that, when these digital spaces come under
coordinated attack, the consequences can be dramatic. Such, sadly, was
the case of Nia Fae Loy, a Portland-based trans rights activist who
gained wide popularity with her OC meme profile Femme4Memes.[^10chapter8_25] After
being violently doxxed and attacked for multiple months through the
trolling platform Kiwi Farms, Nia Fae Loy committed suicide in 2018. In
2019, an Italian user called Pianura Pagana published a eulogy for Nina
Fae Loy on Medium, starting the article by complaining that a popular
meme she had created, featuring two anime girls in front of a political
world map and the words ‘ALL TITS ARE REAL - ALL BORDERS ARE FAKE’, had
been ‘taken’ by tumblr and twitter without crediting the original
source.[^10chapter8_26] The episode shows how proper crediting doesn’t always have
to be about extracting revenue from memes - sometimes it’s just about
the simple recognition of artistic merit (though this in turn may be a
form of symbolic capital to spend with the peer community, to borrow a
concept from French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu).

Still, the main question remains unanswered: why did significant parts
of such a politically militant community decide to use Instagram and
Facebook as platforms? And why do attribution and authorship became so
important for creators of OC memes? To find the answer, we will have to
take a step back and draw upon the all-too-often forgotten notion of
social class.

## PART III: Memers of the World, Unite!

To this day, and despite many admirable efforts, social theory has not
been able to restore the concept of social class back to its old
prominence. One of the most interesting attempts to update this key
notion of Marxist thought was by New Media theorist McKenzie Wark in her
book *A Hacker Manifesto*.[^10chapter8_27] According to Wark, cognitive capitalism
is characterized by a new dynamic of class exploitation, determined by
the control of intellectual property. The result is the emergence of a
new dominating group, which she calls the vectorialist class:

> Whereas the capitalists exploited the laboring and producing classes
> by imposing the property relation on all fields of scarcity, the
> vectoralists are cutting-edge cognitive capitalists who use the
> concept of ‘intellectual property’ to capture and structure the field
> of immaterial labor – a field that actually is not characterized by
> scarcity. In other words, they exploit the hackers, who have yet to
> become conscious of themselves as a new class in the history of class
> struggle.[^10chapter8_28]

When observing the increasingly militant fight for proper attribution
and crediting among members of the OC meme community, we couldn’t help
but ask ourselves: was this just the latest instance of a digital
enclosure driven by the enforcement of the capitalist logic of
intellectual property? Or was this actually an example of the hacker
class’s fight for sovereignty over its own creations against the
vectorialist class? If the latter were truly the case, maybe the puns on
marxist propaganda so popular in the community, such as the invitation
to ‘reclaim the memes of production’, reveal much more than just blasé
millennial humor and wannabe leftist virtue signaling? Could it be that
the hacker class is finally starting to gain self-consciousness?

Certainly, such a reading would explain the tendency of many members of
the OC community to use Instagram and Facebook to monetize their own
creations: only an apparent contradiction, if we look closely. There is
no doubt that Zuckerberg’s platforms excel at offering opportunities to
transform content into revenue: their whole architecture favors the
monetarization of human emotions and affect, as the past years have so
disastrously showed. the creators of OC memes flock to the places that
offer them the best opportunity to monetize their work and if theeager
to enforce a system that grants them credit for their work, since their
financial income depends on itwith the original hacker ethos, which
affirms that ’information wants to be free’?[^10chapter8_29]

Clearly, the presence the hacker class on the vectoralist platforms gave
rise to numerous conflicts and contradictions: from profiles being
cancelled without notice under the infamous pretext of community
policies violation, to the rising frictions with commercial predatory
profiles which appropriate memes without crediting the original authors.
However, all attempts to create some sort of unified resistance
movement, whether through coordinated actions, strikes or even the
creation of a ‘Memers’ Union’, so far have been unsuccessful. An
excellent analysis of the underlying weaknesses of these efforts has
been proposed by the meme research group *The Philosopher’s Meme*:

> The hacker class has never come close to establishing a consciousness
> comparable to that of the vectoralists \[…\]. There are, however, a
> number of artisan classes cohering under vectoralist hegemony.
> ‘YouTubers’ refer to themselves as a such when railing against
> Google’s content and DMCA policies \[…\]. This suggests that the
> hacker class has reached a certain stage wherein class identification
> occurs according to membership in a group which is conscious of its
> unity and homogeneity, and of the need to organize it, but with a
> blindness to the case of the wider social group of Internet users. The
> radicalization and unification of these groups, and the active
> prevention of their assimilation into some kind of ‘petit vectoralist’
> creative class – ‘vectoral’ in the sense that they profit by flows of
> views, likes, and subscribes which their stocks of content generate;
> ‘petit’ insofar as they do not own the vectors upon which they labor –
> is paramount.[^10chapter8_30]

## PART IV: Money Makes the World go Around

For our work on Meme Manifesto, we contacted members of the OC
community—to ask them permission to use their works, but also, as we
were at it, to gain some insights into the topics discussed in this
article. From a first review of their answers, the theory that
monetzation—next to the pull of the platforms’ network effect—has been a
powerful driver towards Instagram and Facebook for former Tumblr users
seems to find some confirmation. An answer by @eel\_merchant is quite
representative in this sense:

> I used to always watermark a meme as a conscious attempt to promote
> growth of my platform, I found it annoying for a meme of mine to go
> viral and not have credit, mainly because I wanted to see how far it
> had spread and without attribution you miss out on that. I care less
> about that now, though - shitposting to the void feels good.

Presently, the OC memers’ awakening into a self-counscious hacker class
seems stuck in a tragic and constant struggle between the need to
monetize original creations on the one hand, and the mirage of a
collective hive mind on the other. On the facebook private group /tpmg/
- TPM Meme Research and Development, one of the many research groups
powered by the blog The Philosopher’s Meme, user Kit Jones summarized a
popular opinion of what a meme should be and why OC memes can’t
(supposedly) exist:

> There is no such thing as an original content meme because a meme is
> not a meme until it has become a meme. It is the first art form that I
> can think of where success is not merely a measure of its popularity
> or its quality, but is actually a necessity of its classification. As
> such, it’s really more like a language than an art form. An
> unsuccessful meme following the format of a prior successful meme is
> still a meme (just a bad meme). An original meme without relation to
> another meme is not yet a meme. It’s just digital artwork. \[…\] A
> meme requires agreement between multiple people. It is necessary for
> people to say “I have seen this before and I know to what it is
> referring”. As such, it mimics language acquisition. \[…\] I would not
> argue against the creation of these images (how could anyone), what I
> would criticise is calling them memes. But hey, what do I know. I’m
> just talking out of my ass.

Yet, at the start of 2021, the need to solve this riddle is becoming
more urgent with every passing week. The 2020-2021 period, which will
certainly go down in history as the stolen years of the pandemic, is
also the time of the *meme d’auteur*. It began with the release of the
documentary ‘Feels Good Man’, which many have seen as Matt Furie's
revenge on the alt-right and his official consecration as the original
creator of Pepe the Frog. And it is continuing with the sale for
\$590,000 of the famous ‘Nyan Cat’ GIF by the Digital Art Market
foundation.app via Non-Fungible Token. This event sets a very important
precedent in the history of the art market and in the history of memes.
It is the first time that a creative and comic book author, Chris
Torres, has been able to sell not just a digital work of art but a meme,
earning 90% of the proceeds from the sale. There has been, needless to
say, some less famous cases of a meme sold as NFT, the Rare Pepe Wallet
being a perfect example. But what struck us about the ‘Nyan Cat’ auction
was the undoubtful declaration, directly printed on the Blockchain, that
Chris Torres, being the creator of Nyan Cat, and the first that actually
posted the GIF on MySpace, was also the sole owner of that marvelous
meme and internet sensation, and therefore his personal signature on the
NFT would be sufficient to attest the official selling of the digital
piece. The Art Market is apparently more than ok with the notion of
*meme d’auteur.*

If we are to prevent a ‘great enclosure’ of the digital commons that is
the memesphere with a scramble to reclaim bits and pieces of this epic
collective artwork for personal financial gain, we should also gain a
deeper understanding of the reasons and motives that favor individual
authorship over collective anonymity. This article wants to be a modest
contribution in this direction. Surely, as long as we are all forced to
endure the economic conditions imposed by late capitalism, it will be
difficult, if not impossible to find an answer to the questions and
contradictions addressed in this article. Ultimately, the issue of
intellectual property will only be solved when we find coordinated,
structural answers to the fake scarcity imposed by cognitive capitalism.
A Universal Basic Income for all could be a first step in the right
direction.

[^10chapter8_29]: However, as Finnish philosopher Pekka Himanen observed, the
    influence of that original hacker ethos on today’s creative class
    might be best understood through the lens of Weber’s study on the
    relationship between protestant ethics and the spirit of
    capitalism—meaning that, just as not all capitalists necessarily
    incorporated protestant ethics in their personal lives, not all
    creatives live according to the strictest precepts of hacker culture
    (see Pekka Himanen, *The Hacker Ethic: and the Spirit of the
    Information Age* (New York: Random House, 2001)).
